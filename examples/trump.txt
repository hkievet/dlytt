 [APPLAUSE] >> MR. SPEAKER, THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET. [APPLAUSE] [INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER] [INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER] [APPLAUSE] >> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] MR. RYAN: MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, I HAD THE HIGH PRIVILEGE AND DISTINCT HONOR OF PRESENTING TO YOU THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MR. SPEAKER, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THE FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS. LESS THAN ONE YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE I FIRST STOOD AT THIS PODIUM, IN THIS MAJESTIC CHAMBER, TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS, THEIR HOPES AND THEIR DREAMS. THAT NIGHT, OUR NEW ADMINISTRATION HAD ALREADY TAKEN VERY SWIFT ACTION. A NEW TIDE OF OPTIMISM WAS ALREADY SWEEPING ACROSS OUR LAND. EACH DAY SINCE, WE HAVE GONE FORWARD WITH A CLEAR VISION AND A RIGHTEOUS MISSION, TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOR ALL AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: OVER THE LAST YEAR, WE HAVE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS AND ACHIEVED EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS. WE HAVE FACED CHALLENGES WE EXPECTED AND OTHERS WE COULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED. WE HAVE SHARED IN THE HEIGHTS OF VICTORY AND THE PAINS OF HARDSHIP. WE HAVE ENDURED FLOODS AND FIRES AND STORMS. BUT THROUGH IT ALL, WE HAVE SEEN THE BEAUTY OF AMERICA'S SOUL AND THE STEEL IN AMERICA'S SPINE. EACH TEST FORGED NEW AMERICAN HEROES TO REMIND US WHO WE ARE, AND SHOW US WHAT WE CAN BE. WE SAW THE VOLUNTEERS OF THE CAJUN NAVY RACING TO THE RESCUE WITH THEIR FISHING BOATS TO SAVE PEOPLE IN THE AFTERMATH OF A TOTALLY DEVASTATING HURRICANE. WE SAW STRANGERS SHIELDING STRANGERS FROM A HAIL OF GUNFIRE ON THE LAS VEGAS STRIP. WE HEARD TALES OF AMERICANS, LIKE COAST GUARD PETTY OFFICER ASHLEE LEPPERT, WHO IS HERE TONIGHT IN THE GALLERY, WITH MELANIA. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ASHLEE WAS ABOARD ONE OF THE FIRST HELICOPTERS IN THE SCENE USED FOR HURRICANE HARVEY. 18 HOURS OF WIND AND RAIN, ASHLEE BRAVED POWERLINES -- DOWNED POWER LINES AND DEEPWATER TO SAVE 40 LIVES. ASHLEE, WE ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE HEARD ABOUT AMERICANS LIKE FIREFIGHTER DAVID DAHLBERG. HE IS HERE WITH US ALSO. DAVID FACED DOWN WALLS OF FLAME TO RESCUE ALMOST 60 CHILDREN TRAPPED IN A CALIFORNIA SUMMER CAMP, THREATENED BY THOSE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. TO EVERYONE STILL RECOVERING IN TEXAS, FLORIDA, LOUISIANA, PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, EVERYWHERE, WE ARE WITH YOU, WE LOVE YOU, AND WE ALWAYS WILL PULL THROUGH TOGETHER, ALWAYS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU TO DAVID AND THE BRAVE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DAVID. GREAT JOB. SOME TRIALS OVER THE PAST YEAR TOUCHED THIS CHAMBER VERY PERSONALLY. WITH US TONIGHT IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST PEOPLE EVER TO SERVE IN THIS HOUSE, A GUY WHO TOOK A BULLET, ALMOST DIED, AND WAS BACK TO WORK THREE AND A HALF MONTHS LATER. THE LEGEND FROM LOUISIANA, CONGRESSMAN STEVE SCALISE. I THINK THEY LIKE YOU, STEVE. WE ARE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF THE CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS, THE ALEXANDRIA POLICE, AND THE DOCTORS, NURSES, AND PARAMEDICS WHO SAVED HIS LIFE AND THE LIVES OF MANY OTHERS READ SOME IN THIS ROOM -- OF MANY OTHERS, SOME IN THIS ROOM. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT TERRIBLE SHOOTING WE CAME TOGETHER, NOT AS REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS, BUT AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE. BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO COME TOGETHER ONLY IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY. TONIGHT, I CALL ON ALL OF US TO SET ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES, TO SEEK OUT COMMON GROUND, AND TO SUMMON THE UNITY WE NEED TO DELIVER FOR THE PEOPLE. THIS IS REALLY THE KEY. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WE ARE ELECTED TO SERVE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: OVER THE LAST YEAR, THE WORLD HAS SEEN WHAT WE ALWAYS KNOW. THAT NO PEOPLE ON EARTH ARE SO FEARLESS OR DARING OR DETERMINED AS AMERICANS. IF THERE IS A MOUNTAIN, WE CLIMATE. IF THERE IS A FRONTIER, WE CROSS IT. IF THERE IS A CHALLENGE, WE TAME IT. IF THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY, WE SEIZE IT. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT BY RECOGNIZING THAT THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS STRONG, BECAUSE OUR PEOPLE ARE STRONG. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND TOGETHER WE ARE BUILDING A SAFE, STRONG AND PROUD AMERICA. SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE CREATED 2.4 MILLION NEW JOBS, INCLUDING -- [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: -- INCLUDING 200,000 NEW JOBS IN MANUFACTURING ALONE. TREMENDOUS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF WAGES STAGNATION, WE ARE FINALLY SEEING RISING WAGES. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS HAVE HIT A 45 YEAR LOW. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND SOMETHING I AM VERY PROUD OF, AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT STANDS AT THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND HISPANIC AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAS ALSO REACHED THE LOWEST LEVELS IN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SMALL BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. THE STOCK MARKET HAS SMASHED ONE RECORD AFTER ANOTHER, GAINING A TRILLION DOLLARS AND MORE IN A VALUE IN JUST THIS SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THE GREAT NEWS FOR AMERICANS, 401K, RETIREMENT, PENSION AND COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF. AND JUST AS I PROMISED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THIS PODIUM 11 MONTHS AGO, WE ENACTED THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: OUR MASSIVE TAX CUTS PROVIDE TREMENDOUS RELIEF FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, TO LOWER TAX RATES FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. WE NEARLY DOUBLED THE STANDARD DEDUCTION FOR EVERYONE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: NOW, THE FIRST $24,000 EARNED BY A MARRIED COUPLE IS COMPLETELY TAX-FREE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ALSO DOUBLED THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: A TYPICAL FAMILY OF FOUR MAKING $75,000 WILL SEE THEIR TAX BILL REDUCED BY $2000, SLASHING THEIR TAX BILL IN HALF. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IN APRIL, THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME YOU WILL EVER FILE UNDER THE OLD AND VERY BROKEN SYSTEM. AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL HAVE MORE TAKE-HOME PAY, STARTING NEXT MONTH. A LOT MORE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ELIMINATED AND ESPECIALLY -- AN ESPECIALLY CRUEL TAX FL ON AMERICANS MAKING LESS THAN $50,000 A YEAR, FORCING THEM TO PAY TREMENDOUS PENALTIES, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD GOVERNMENT-ORDERED HEALTH PLANS. WE REPEALED THE CORE OF THE DISASTROUS OBAMACARE, THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS NOW GONE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE SLASHED THE BUSINESS TAX RATE FROM 35%, ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 20 -- 21%. SO AMERICAN COMPANIES CAN COMPETE AGAINST ANYONE, ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THESE CHANGES ALONE ARE ESTIMATED TO INCREASE AVERAGE FAMILY INCOME BY MORE THAN $4000, A LOT OF MONEY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE ALSO RECEIVED A MASSIVE TAX CUT, AND CAN NOW DEDUCT 20% OF THEIR BUSINESS INCOME. HERE TONIGHT ARE STEVE STAUB AND SANDY KEPLINGER OF STAUB MANUFACTURING, A SMALL, BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS IN OHIO. THEY HAVE JUST FINISHED THEIR BEST YEAR IN THEIR 20 YEAR HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: BECAUSE OF TAX REFORM, THEY ARE HANDING OUT RAISES, HIRING AN ADDITIONAL 14 PEOPLE, AND EXPANDING INTO THE BID -- INTO THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ONE OF STAUB'S EMPLOYEES, COREY ADAMS, IS ALSO WITH US TONIGHT. COREY IS AN ALL-AMERICAN WORKER. HE SUPPORTED HIMSELF THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, LOST HIS JOB DURING THE 2008 RECESSION, AND WAS LATER HIRED BY STAUB, WHERE HE TRAINED TO BECOME A WELDER. LIKE MANY HARD-WORKING AMERICANS, CORI PLANS TO INVEST HIS TAX CUT RAYS INTO HIS NEW HOME, AND HIS TWO DAUGHTERS' EDUCATION. COREY, PLEASE STAND. [APPLAUSE] >> AND HE IS A GREAT WELDER. I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT OWNS THAT COMPANY THAT DOES THAT SO WELL. CONGRATULATIONS, COREY. SINCE WE PASSED TAX CUTS, OVER 300 MILLION WORKERS HAVE GOTTEN TAX CUT BONUSES. MANY OF THEM, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. IT IS GETTING MORE EVERY MONTH, EVERY WEEK. APPLE HAS JUST ANNOUNCED IT PLANS TO INVEST A TOTAL OF $350 BILLION IN AMERICA, AND HIRE AN ADDITIONAL 20,000 WORKERS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO, EXXON MOBIL ANNOUNCED A $50 BILLION INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THIS, IN FACT, IS OUR NEW AMERICAN MOMENT. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO START LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM. SO, TO EVERY CITIZEN WATCHING AT HOME TONIGHT, NO MATTER WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN OR WHERE YOU HAVE COME FROM, THIS IS YOUR TIME. IF YOU WORK HARD, IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, IF YOU BELIEVE IN AMERICA, THEN YOU CAN DREAM ANYTHING, BE ANYTHING. AND TOGETHER, WE CAN ACHIEVE ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TONIGHT, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF FUTURE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE, AND WHAT KIND OF A NATION WE ARE GOING TO BE. ALL OF US, TOGETHER, AS ONE TEAM, ONE PEOPLE, AND ONE AMERICAN FAMILY, CAN DO ANYTHING. WE ALL SHARE THE SAME HOME, THE SAME HEART, THE SAME DESTINY, AND THE SAME GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TOGETHER, WE ARE REDISCOVERING THE AMERICAN WAY. IN AMERICA, WE KNOW THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE CENTER OF AMERICAN LIFE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THE MOTTO IS, IN GOD WE TRUST. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND WE CELEBRATE OUR BELIEFS, -- OUR POLICE, OUR MILITARY, AND VETERANS AS HEROES WHO DESERVE OUR TOTAL AND UNWAVERING SUPPORT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: HERE TONIGHT IS PRESTON SHARP, A 12 EURO BOY FROM -- A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY FROM REDDING, CALIFORNIA, WHO NOTICED VETERANS' GRAVES WERE NOT DECORATED WITH FLAGS ON VETERANS DAY. HE DECIDED TO CHANGE THAT AND HAS STARTED A MOVEMENT WHICH HAS NOW PLACED 40,000 FLAGS AT THE GRAVES OF OUR GREAT HEROES. PRESTON, A JOB WELL DONE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: YOUNG PATRIOTS LIKE PRESTON TEACH ALL OF US ABOUT OUR CIVIC DUTY AS AMERICANS. I MET PRESTON A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND HE IS SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. GREAT FUTURE. THANK YOU, PRESTON. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. PRESTON'S REVERENCE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED OUR NATION REMIND US WHY WE SALUTE OUR FLAG, WHY WE PUT OUR HANDS ON OUR HEARTS FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, AND WHY WE PROUDLY STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AMERICANS LOVE THEIR COUNTRY, AND THEY DESERVE A GOVERNMENT THAT SHOWS THEM THE SAME LOVE AND LOYALTY IN RETURN. FOR THE LAST YEAR, WE HAVE THOUGHT TO RESTORE THE BONDS OF TRUST BETWEEN OUR CITIZENS AND THEIR GOVERNMENT. WORKING WITH THE SENATE, WE ARE APPOINTING JUDGES WHO WILL INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN, INCLUDING A GREAT NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, AND MORE CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES, THAN ANY NEW ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ARE TOTALLY DEFENDING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT, AND HAVE TAKEN HISTORIC ACTIONS TO PROTECT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND WE ARE SERVING OUR BRAVE OF VETERANS, INCLUDING GIVING OUR VETERANS CHOICE IN THEIR HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: LAST YEAR, CONGRESS ALSO PASSED, AND I SIGNED, THE LANDMARK THE A ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SINCE ITS PASSAGE, AND MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY MOVED MORE THAN 1500 V.A. EMPLOYEES WHO FAIL TO GIVE OUR VETERANS THE CARE THEY DESERVE. AND WE ARE HIRING PEOPLE WHO LOVE OUR VETS AS MUCH AS WE DO. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL OUR VETERANS ARE PROPERLY TAKEN CARE OF. WHICH HAS BEEN MY PROMISE TO THEM FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS GREAT JOURNEY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ALL AMERICANS DESERVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPECT. AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GIVING TO OUR WONDERFUL HEROES, OUR VETERANS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SO TONIGHT I CALL ON CONGRESS TO EMPOWER EVERY CABINET SECRETARY WITH THE AUTHORITY TO REWARD GOOD WORKERS AND TO REMOVE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES WHO UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC TRUST, OR FAIL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IN OUR DRIVE TO MAKE WASHINGTON ACCOUNTABLE, WE HAVE ELIMINATED MORE REGULATIONS IN OUR FIRST YEAR THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY. AND WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ARE NOW VERY PROUDLY AND EXPORTER OF ENERGY TO THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IN DETROIT, I HALTED GOVERNMENT MANDATES THAT CRIPPLED AMERICAN'S GREAT WORKERS, SO WE CAN GET MOTOR CITY REVVING ITS ENGINES AGAIN. AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MANY CAR COMPANIES ARE NOW BUILDING AND EXPANDING PLANS IN THE UNITED STATES, SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN DECADES. CHRYSLER IS MOVING A MAJOR PLANT FROM MEXICO TO MICHIGAN. TOYOTA AND MAZDA ARE OPENING UP A PLANT IN ALABAMA, A BIG ONE. AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS IN A LONG TIME. IT IS ALL COMING BACK. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: VERY SOON, AUTO PLANTS AND OTHER PLANTS WILL BE OPENING UP ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS ALL NEWS AMERICANS ARE TOTALLY UNACCUSTOMED TO HEARING. FOR MANY YEARS, COMPANIES AND JOBS WERE ONLY LEAVING US. BUT NOW, THEY ARE ROARING BACK, THEY ARE COMING BACK, THEY WANT TO BE WHERE THE ACTION IS. THEY WANT TO BE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHERE THEY WANT TO GO. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: EXCITING PROGRESS IS HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE DAY. TO SPEED ACCESS TO BREAKTHROUGHS, CURES, AND AFFORDABLE GENERIC DRUGS, LAST YEAR, THE FDA APPROVED MORE NEW AND GENERIC DRUGS AND MEDICAL DEVICES THAN EVER BEFORE IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PATIENTS WITH TERMINAL CONDITIONS, TERMINAL ILLNESSES, SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY THAT COULD ESSENTIALLY SAVE THEIR LIVES. PEOPLE WHO ARE TERMINALLY ILL SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY TO SEEK A CURE. I WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE RIGHT HERE AT HOME. IT IS TIME FOR CONGRESS TO GIVE THESE WONDERFUL, INCREDIBLE AMERICANS THE RIGHT TO TRY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ONE OF MY GREATEST PRIORITIES IS TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, THESE DRUGS COST FAR LESS THAN WHAT WE PAY IN THE UNITED STATES. AND IT IS VERY, VERY UNFAIR. THAT IS WHY I DIRECTED MY ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE FIXING THE INJUSTICE OF HIGH DRUG PRICES ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES FOR THE YEAR. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND PRICES WILL COME DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY. WATCH. AMERICA HAS ALSO FINALLY TURNED A PAGE ON DECADES OF UNFAIR TRADE DEALS THAT SACRIFICED OUR PROSPERITY AND SHIPPED AWAY OUR COMPANIES, OUR JOBS, AND/OR WEALTH -- AND OUR WEALTH. OUR NATION HAS LOST ITS WEALTH, BUT WE ARE GETTING IT BACK SO FAST. THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS OVER. FROM NOW ONE, WE EXPECT TRADING RELATIONSHIPS TO BE FAIR. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, RECIPROCAL. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WILL WORK TO FIX BAD TRADE DEALS AND NEGOTIATE NEW ONES. AND THEY WILL BE GOOD ONES. BUT THEY WILL BE FAIR. AND WE WILL PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THROUGH STRONG ENFORCEMENT OF OUR TRADE RULES. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS WE REBUILD OUR INDUSTRIES, IT IS ALSO TIME TO REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AMERICA IS A NATION OF BUILDERS. WE BUILT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING IN JUST ONE YEAR. ISN'T IT A DISGRACE THAT IT CAN NOW TAKE 10 YEARS JUST TO GET A MINOR PERMIT APPROVED FOR THE BUILDING OF A SIMPLE ROAD? [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I AM ASKING BOTH PARTIES TO COME TOGETHER TO GIVE US SAFE, FAST, RELIABLE AND MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT OUR ECONOMY NEEDS AND OUR PEOPLE DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TONIGHT, I AM CALLING ON CONGRESS TO PRODUCE A BILL THAT GENERATES AT LEAST $1.5 TRILLION FOR THE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT OUR COUNTRY SO DESPERATELY NEEDS. EVERY FEDERAL DOLLAR SHOULD BE LEVERAGED BY PARTNERING WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, TAPPING INTO PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT, TO PERMANENTLY FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIT. AND WE CAN DO. -- AND WE CAN DI IT -- DO IT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ANY BILL MUST ALSO STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING PROCESS, GETTING IT DOWN TO NO MORE THAN TWO YEARS, AND PERHAPS, EVEN ONE. TOGETHER, WE CAN RECLAIM OUR GREAT BUILDING HERITAGE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WILL BUILD GLEAMING NEW ROADS, BRIDGES, HIGHWAYS, RAILWAYS AND WATERWAYS ALL ACROSS OUR LAND. AND WE WILL DO IT WITH AMERICAN HEART, AMERICAN HANDS, AND AMERICAN GRIT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WANT EVERY AMERICAN TO KNOW THE DIGNITY OF A HARD DAY'S WORK. WE WANT EVERY CHILD TO BE SAFE IN THEIR HOME AND NIGHT. AND WE WANT EVERY CITIZEN TO BE PROUD OF THIS LAND THAT WE ALL LOVE SO MUCH. WE CAN LIFT OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE, AND FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS TAX CUTS CREATE NEW JOBS, LET'S INVEST IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND LET'S INVEST IN JOB TRAINING, WHICH WE NEED SO BADLY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: LET'S OPEN GREAT VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS, SO OUR FUTURE WORKERS CAN LEARN A CRAFT AND REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND LET'S SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES BY SUPPORTING PAID FAMILY LEAVE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS AMERICA REGAINS ITS STRENGTH, OPPORTUNITY MUST BE EXTENDED TO ALL CITIZENS. THAT IS WHY THIS YEAR WE WILL EMBARK ON REFORMING OUR PRISONS, TO HELP FORMER INMATES WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME GET A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES, WILL ALSO BE HELPED BY IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT FOCUS ON THE BEST INTERESTS OF AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN FAMILIES. FOR DECADES, OPEN BORDERS HAVE ALLOWED DRUGS AND GANGS TO POUR INTO OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THEY HAVE ALLOWED MILLIONS OF LOW-WAGE WORKERS TO COMPETE FOR JOBS AND WAGES AGAINST OF THE POOREST AMERICANS. MOST TRAGICALLY, THEY HAVE CAUSED THE LOSS OF MANY INNOCENT LIVES. HERE TONIGHT ARE TWO FATHERS AND TWO MOTHERS, EVELYN RODRIGUEZ, FREDDY CUEVAS, ELIZABETH ALVARADO, AND ROBERT MICKENS. THEIR TWO TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, KAYLA CUEVAS AND NISA MICKENS, WERE CLOSE FRIENDS ON RHODE ISLAND. BUT IN DECEMBER, 2016, ON THE EVE OF NISA'S 16TH BIRTHDAY, SUCH A HAPPY TIME IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, NEITHER OF THEM CAME HOME. THESE TWO PRECIOUS GIRLS WERE MURDERED -- BRUTALLY MURDERED WHILE WALKING TOGETHER IN THEIR HOMETOWN. SIX MEMBERS OF THE SAVAGE MS-13 GANG HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH KAYLA AND NISA'S MURDERS. MANY OF THESE GANG MEMBERS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF GLARING LOOPHOLES AND OUR LAWS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY AS ILLEGAL, UNACCOMPANIED, ALIEN MINORS. AND WOUND UP IN KAYLA AND NISA'S HIGH SCHOOL. EVELYN, FREDDY, ELIZABETH, AND ROBERT. EVERYONE STANDS, WE ARE GRIEVING WITH YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT 320 MILLION PARTS ARE RIGHT -- 320 MILLION HEARTS ARE RIGHT NOW BREAKING FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE CANNOT IMAGINE THE DEPTHS OF THAT KIND OF SORROW. WE CAN MAKE SURE OTHER FAMILIES DO NOT HAVE TO ENDURE THIS KIND OF PAIN. TONIGHT I AM CALLING ON CONGRESS TO FINALLY CLOSE THE DEADLY LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE ALLOWED MS-13 AND OTHER CRIMINAL GANGS TO BREAK INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE PROPOSED NEW LEGISLATION THAT WILL FIX OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS AND SUPPORT OUR I.C.E. AND BORDER PATROL AGENTS. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE, THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE WHO WORK SO HARD IN THE MIDST OF SUCH DANGER, SO THAT THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THE UNITED STATES IS A COMPASSIONATE NATION. WE ARE PROUD THAT WE DO MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, TO HELP THE NEEDY, THE STRUGGLING, AND THE UNDERPRIVILEGED, ALL OVER THE WORLD. BUT AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MY HIGHEST LOYALTY, MY GREATEST COMPASSION, MY CONSTANT CONCERN, IS FOR AMERICA'S CHILDREN, AMERICA'S STRUGGLING WORKERS, AND AMERICA'S FORGOTTEN COMMUNITIES. I WANT OUR YOUTH TO GROW UP TO ACHIEVE GREAT THINGS. I WANT OUR POOR TO HAVE THEIR CHANCE TO RISE. SO TONIGHT, I AM EXTENDING AN OPEN HAND TO WORK WITH MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS OF EVERY BACKGROUND, COLOR, RELIGION AND CREED. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MY DUTY, AND THE SACRED DUTY OF EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THIS CHAMBER, IS TO DEFEND AMERICANS, TO PROTECT THEIR SAFETY, THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND THEIR RIGHT TO THE AMERICAN DREAM. BECAUSE AMERICANS ARE DREAMERS, TOO. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: HERE TONIGHT IS ONE LEADER IN THE EFFORT TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY, HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATION SPECIAL AGENT, CELESTINO MARTINEZ. HE GOES BY DJ AND CJ. HE SAYS, CALL ME EITHER ONE. WE WILL GO BY CJ. YEARS IN THE AIR FORCE BEFORE BECOMING AN I.C.E. AGENT, AND FACING GANG VIOLENCE IN DANGEROUS CRIMINALS, GETTING THEM OFF OUR STREETS. TOUGH JOB. AT ONE POINT, MS-13 LEADERS ORDERED CJ'S MURDER, AND THEY WANTED IT TO HAPPEN QUICKLY. BUT HE DID NOT CAVE TO THREATS OR TO FEAR. LAST MAY, HE COMMANDED AN OPERATION TO TRACK DOWN AGAIN MEMBERS IN LONG ISLAND. HIS TEAM HAS ARRESTED NEARLY 400, INCLUDING NEARLY 220 MS-13 GANG MEMBERS. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHAT THE BORDER PATROL AND I.C.E. HAVE DONE, WE HAVE SENT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MS-13 HORRIBLE PEOPLE OUT OF THIS COUNTRY, OR INTO OUR PRISONS. SO I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU, CJ. YOU ARE A BRAVE GUY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND I ASKED CJ, WHAT IS THE SECRET? HE JUST SAID, WE ARE TOUGHER THAN THEY ARE. AND I LIKE THAT ANSWER. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: NOW, LET'S GET CONGRESS TO SEND YOU AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS GREAT CHAMBER -- WE HAVE TO DO IT, WE HAVE NO CHOICE. CJ, WE ARE GOING TO SEND YOU REINFORCEMENTS, AND WE ARE GOING TO SEND THEM TO YOU QUICKLY. IT IS WHAT YOU NEED. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, THE HOUSE AND SENATE WILL BE VOTING ON AN IMMIGRATION REFORM PACKAGE. IN RECENT MONTHS, MY ADMINISTRATION HAS MET EXTENSIVELY WITH BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO CRAFT A BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION REFORM. BASED ON THESE DISCUSSIONS, WE PRESENTED CONGRESS WITH A DETAILED PROPOSAL THAT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY BOTH PARTIES AS A FAIR COMPROMISE. ONE WHERE NOBODY GETS EVERYTHING THEY WANT, BUT WHERE OUR COUNTRY GETS THE CRITICAL REFORMS IT NEEDS AND MUST HAVE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: HERE ARE THE FOUR PILLARS OF OUR PLAN. THE FIRST PILLAR OF OUR FRAMEWORK GENEROUSLY OFFERS A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR 1.8 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO WERE BROUGHT HERE BY THEIR PARENTS AT A YOUNG AGE. THAT COVERS ALMOST THREE TIMES MORE PEOPLE THAN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION COVERED. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: UNDER OUR PLAN, THOSE WHO MEET EDUCATION AND WORK REQUIREMENTS, AND SHOW GOOD MORAL CHARACTER, WILL BE ABLE TO BECOME A FULL CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES OVER A 12 YEAR PERIOD. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THE SECOND PILLAR FULLY SECURES THE BORDER. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THAT MEANS BUILDING A GREAT WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER, AND IT MEANS HIRING MORE HEROES LIKE CJ TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: CRUCIALLY, OUR PLAN CLOSES THE TERRIBLE LOOPHOLES EXPLOITED BY CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS TO ENTER OUR COUNTRY. AND IT FINALLY ENDS THE HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS PRACTICE OF CATCH AND RELEASE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THE THIRD PILLAR AND -- ENDS THE VISA LOTTERY, A PROGRAM THAT RANDOMLY PLANS OUT GREEN CARDS WITHOUT REGARD FOR SKILL, MERIT, FOR THE SAFETY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TIME TO BEGIN MOVING TOWARD A MERIT BASED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. ONE THAT ADMITS PEOPLE WHO ARE SKILLED. WHO WANT TO WORK. WHO WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY. AND WHO WILL LOVE AND RESPECT OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THE FOURTH AND FINAL PILLAR PROTECTS THE NUCLEAR FAMILY NIGHT ENDING CHAIN MIGRATION. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: UNDER THE CURRENT, BROKEN SYSTEM. A SINGLE IMMIGRANT CAN BRING IN UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF DISTANT RELATIVES. UNDER OUR PLAN WE FOCUS ON THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY BY ELIMINATING SPONSORSHIPS -- BY LIMITING SPONSORSHIPS TO SPOUSES AND MINOR CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THIS VITAL REFORM IS NECESSARY NOT JUST FOR OUR  ECONOMY, BUT FOR OUR SECURITY AND THE FUTURE OF AMERICA. IN RECENT WEEKS, TO TERRORIST ATTACKS IN NEW YORK WERE A POSSIBLE BY THE VISA LOTTERY AND CHANGE MIGRATION. IN THE AGE OF TERRORISM, THESE PROGRAMS PRESENT RISKS WE CAN JUST KNOW LONGER AFFORD -- NO LONGER AFFORD. IT IS TIME FOR REFORM. [APPLAUSE] THESE OUTDATED IMMIGRATION RULES CAN FINALLY BRING OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THESE FOUR PILLARS REPRESENT A DOWN THE MIDDLE COMPROMISE AND ONE THAT WILL CREATE A SAFE, MODERN, AND LAWFUL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. FOR OVER 30 YEARS, WASHINGTON HAS TRIED AND FAILED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THIS CONGRESS CAN BE THE ONE THAT FINALLY MAKES IT HAPPEN. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THESE FOUR PILLARS WILL PRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT FULFILLS MY IRONCLAD PLEDGE TO SIGN A BILL THAT PUTS AMERICA FIRST. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SO LET'S COME TOGETHER, THAT POLITICS ASIDE, AND FINALLY GET THE JOB DONE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THESE REFORMS WILL ALSO SUPPORT OUR RESPONSE TO THE TERRIBLE CRISIS OF OPIOID AND DRUG ADDICTION. NEVER BEFORE HAS IT BEEN LIKE IT IS NOW. IT IS TERRIBLE. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IN 2016, WE LOST 64,000 AMERICANS TO DRUG OVERDOSES. 174 DEATHS PER DAY. SEVEN PER HOUR. WE MUST GET MUCH TOUGHER ON DRUG DEALERS AND PUSHERS IF WE ARE GOING TO SUCCEED IN STOPPING THIS SCORCH. -- SCOURGE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MY ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO FIGHTING THE DRUG EPIDEMIC AND HELPING GET TREATMENT FOR THOSE IN NEED. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SO TERRIBLY HURT, THE STRUGGLE WILL BE LONG AND IT WILL BE DIFFICULT. AS AMERICANS ALWAYS DO, IN THE END WE WILL SUCCEED. WE WILL PREVAIL. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS WE HAVE SEEN TONIGHT, THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES BRING OUT THE BEST IN AMERICA. WE SEE A VIVID EXPRESSION OF THIS IN THE STORY OF THE FAMILY OF NEW MEXICO. RYAN IS 27 YEARS OLD. AN OFFICER WITH THE ALBUQUERQUE POLICE DEPARTMENT. HE IS HERE TONIGHT WITH HIS WIFE, REBECCA. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU, RYAN. LAST YEAR RYAN WAS ON DUTY WHEN HE SAW A PREGNANT, HOMELESS WOMAN PREPARING TO INJECT HEROIN. WHEN BRIAN TOLD HER SHE WAS GOING TO HARM HER UNBORN CHILD, SHE BEGAN TO WEEP. SHE TOLD HIM SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN, BUT BADLY WANTED A SAFE HOME FOR HER BABY. IN THAT MOMENT, RYAN SAID HE FELT GOD SPEAK TO HIM. YOU WILL DO IT, BECAUSE YOU CAN. HE HEARD THOSE WORDS. HE TOOK OUT A PICTURE OF HIS WIFE AND THEREFORE KIDS. THEN HE WENT HOME TO TELL HIS WIFE REBECCA. IN AN INSTANT, SHE AGREED TO ADOPT. THEY NAMED THEIR NEW DAUGHTER HOPE. RYAN AND REBECCA, YOU EMBODY THE GOODNESS OF OUR NATION. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU, RYAN AND REBECCA. AS WE REBUILD AMERICA'S STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE AT HOME, WE ARE ALSO RESTORING OUR STRENGTH AND STANDING ABROAD. AROUND THE WORLD WE RACE ROGUE REGIMES, TERRORIST GROUPS, AND RIVALS LIKE CHINA AND RUSSIA THAT CHALLENGE OUR INTEREST, OUR ECONOMY, AND OUR VALUES. IN CONFRONTING THESE HORRIBLE DANGERS, WE KNOW THAT WEAKNESS IS THE SUREST PATH TO CONFLICT. UNMATCHED POWER IS THE SUREST MEANS TO OUR TRUE AND GREAT DEFENSE. FOR THIS REASON, I AM ASKING CONGRESS TO END THE DANGEROUS DEFENSE SEQUESTER AND FULLY FUND OUR GREAT MILITARY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS PART OF OUR DEFENSE, WE MUST MODERNIZE AND REBUILD OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL. HOPEFULLY NEVER HAVING TO USE IT, BUT MAKING IT SO STRONG AND SO POWERFUL THAT IT WILL DETER ANY ACTS OF AGGRESSION BY ANY OTHER NATION OR ANYONE ELSE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: PERHAPS SOME DAY IN THE FUTURE, THERE WILL BE A MAGICAL MOMENT WHEN THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD WILL GET TOGETHER TO ELIMINATE THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE NOT THERE YET, SADLY. LAST YEAR, I ALSO PLEDGED THAT WE WOULD WORK WITH OUR ALLIES TO EXTINGUISH ISIS FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. ONE YEAR LATER, I AM PROUD TO REPORT THAT THE COALITION TO DEFEAT ISIS HAS LIBERATED VERY CLOSE TO 100% OF THE TERRITORY JUST RECENTLY HELD BY THESE KILLERS IN IRAQ AND IN SYRIA AND IN OTHER LOCATIONS AS WELL. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: BUT THERE IS MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. WE WILL CONTINUE OUR FIGHT UNTIL ISIS IS DEFEATED. ARMY STAFF SERGEANT JUSTIN PECK IS HERE TONIGHT. JUSTIN AND HIS COMRADE, CHIEF EDDIE OFFICER CANTON STACY WERE CLEARING A BUILDING THAT ISIS HAD RIGGED WITH EXPLOSIVES SO THAT CIVILIANS COULD RETURN TO THAT CITY HOPEFULLY SOON AND HOPEFULLY A FLEET. -- HOPEFULLY SAFELY. KENTON STACEY WAS SEVERELY WOUNDED BY AN EXPLOSION. IMMEDIATELY, JUSTIN BOUNDED INTO THE BOOBY-TRAPPED AND DANGEROUS AND UNSAFE BUILDING AND FOUND KENTON IN VERY BAD SHAPE. HE APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE WOUND AND INSERTED A TUBE TO REOPEN AN AIRWAY. HE PERFORMED CPR FOR 20 STRAIGHT MINUTES DURING THE GROUND TRANSPORT AND MAINTAINED ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION THROUGH 2.5 HOURS AND THROUGH EMERGENCY SURGERY. KENTON STACEY WOULD HAVE DIED IF IT WERE NOT FOR JUSTIN'S LOVE FOR HIS FELLOW WARRIOR. TONIGHT, KENTON IS RECOVERING IN TEXAS. JUSTICE IS WEARING HIS NEW BRONZE STAR WITH A V FOR VALOR. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TERRORISTS WHO DO THINGS LIKE PLACE BOMBS IN CIVILIAN HOSPITALS ARE EVIL. WHEN POSSIBLE, WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ANNIHILATE THEM. WHEN NECESSARY, WE MUST BE ABLE TO DETAIN AND QUESTION THEM. BUT WE MUST BE CLEAR. TERRORISTS ARE NOT NEARLY CRIMINALS, THEY ARE UNLAWFUL ENEMY COMBATANTS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND WHEN CAPTURED OVERSEAS, THEY SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE THE TERRORISTS THEY ARE. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE LOOSELY RELEASED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DANGEROUS TERRORIST'S ONLY TO MEET THEM AGAIN ON THE BATTLEFIELD. INCLUDING THE ISIS LEADER WHO WE CAPTURED AND WHO WE HAD AND WHO WE RELEASED. TODAY I AM KEEPING ANOTHER PROMISE. I JUST SIGNED, PRIOR TO WALKING IN, AND ORDER DIRECTING SECRETARY MATTIS, WHO IS DOING A GREAT JOB -- THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TO RE-EXAMINE OUR MILITARY DETENTION POLICY AND TO KEEP OPEN THE DETENTION THE CIVILITY'S IN -- DETENTION FACILITIES IN GUANTANAMO BAY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I AM ASKING CONGRESS TO ENSURE THAT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS AND AL QAEDA, WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ALL NECESSARY POWER TO DETAIN TERRORISTS WHEREVER WE CHASE THEM DOWN, WHEREVER WE FIND THEM, AND IN MANY CASES FOR THEM IT WILL NOW BE GUANTANAMO BAY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AT THE SAME TIME, AS OF A FEW MONTHS AGO, OUR WARRIORS IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE NEW RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ALONG WITH THEIR HEROIC AFGHAN PARTNERS, OUR MILITARY IS NO LONGER UNDERMINED BY ARTIFICIAL TIMELINES AND WE NO LONGER TELL OUR ENEMIES OUR PLANS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: LAST MONTH I ALSO TOOK AN ACTION ENDORSED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE U.S. SENATE, JUST MONTHS BEFORE. I RECOGNIZED JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SHORTLY AFTERWARD, DOZENS OF COUNTRIES VOTED IN THE UNITED NATION'S GENERAL ASSEMBLY AGAINST AMERICA'S SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO MAKE THIS DECISION. IN 2016, AMERICAN TAXPAYERS GENEROUSLY SENT THOSE SAME COUNTRIES MORE THAN $20 BILLION IN AID. THAT IS WHY, TONIGHT, I AM ASKING CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION TO HELP ENSURE AMERICAN FOREIGN ASSISTANCE DOLLARS ALWAYS SERVED AMERICAN INTERESTS AND ONLY GO TO FRIENDS OF AMERICA, NOT ENEMIES. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS WE STRENGTHEN FRIENDSHIPS ALL AROUND THE WORLD , WE ARE ALSO RESTORING CLARITY ABOUT OUR ADVERSARIES. WHEN THE PEOPLE OF IRAN ROSE UP AGAINST THE CRIMES OF THEIR CORRUPT DICTATORSHIP, I DID NOT STAY SILENT. AMERICA STANDS WITH THE PEOPLE OF IRAN IN THEIR COURAGEOUS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I AM ASKING CONGRESS TO ADDRESS A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN THE TERRIBLE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO IMPOSED TOUGH SANCTIONS ON THE COMMUNIST AND SOCIALIST DICTATORSHIPS IN CUBA AND THAT A SWELL A. -- VENEZUELA. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: BUT NO REGIME HAS OPPRESSED ITS OWN CITIZENS MORE TOTALLY, MORE BRUTALLY, THEN THE CRUEL DICTATORSHIP IN NORTH KOREA. NORTH KOREA'S RECKLESS PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR MISSILES COULD VERY SOON THREATEN OUR HOMELAND. WE ARE WAGING A CAMPAIGN OF MAXIMUM PRESSURE TO PREVENT THAT FROM EVER HAPPENING. PAST EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US THAT COMPLACENCY AND CONCESSIONS ONLY INVITE AGGRESSION AND PROVOCATION. I WILL NOT REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF PAST ADMINISTRATIONS THAT GOT US INTO THIS VERY DANGEROUS POSITION. WE NEED ONLY LOOK AT THE DEPRAVED CHARACTER OF THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE NUCLEAR THREAT IT COULD POSE TO AMERICA AND TO OUR ALLIES. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, AND A GREAT STUDENT HE WAS. ON HIS WAY TO STUDY ABROAD IN ASIA, OTTO JOINED A TWO OR TWO NORTH KOREA. AT ITS CONCLUSION, THIS WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH CRIMES AGAINST THE STATE. AFTER A SHAMEFUL TRIAL, THE DICTATORSHIP SENTENCED OTTO TO 15 YEARS OF HARD LABOR BEFORE RETURNING HIM TO AMERICA LAST JUNE, HORRIBLY INJURED, AND ON THE VERGE OF DEATH. HE PASSED AWAY JUST DAYS AFTER HIS RETURN. OTTO'S WONDERFUL PARENTS, FRED AND CINDY ARE HERE WITH US TONIGHT ALONG WITH HIS BROTHER AND SISTER, AUSTIN AND GRETA. PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. YOU ARE POWERFUL WITNESSES TO A MENACE THAT THREATENS OUR WORLD, AND YOUR STRENGTH TRULY INSPIRES US ALL. INC. YOU VERY MUCH. -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TONIGHT WE PLEDGE TO HONOR OTTO'S MEMORY WITH TOTAL AMERICAN RESULTS. -- RESOLVE.  THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: FINALLY, WE ARE JOINED BY ONE MORE WITNESS TO THE OMINOUS NATURE OF THIS REGIME. HIS NAME IS MR. G SUNG HO. IN 1966, SUNG HO WAS A STARVING BOY IN NORTH KOREA. ONE DAY HE TRIED TO STEAL WHOLE TO BARTER FOR A FEW SCRAPS OF FOOD. IN THE PROCESS, HE PASSED OUT ON THE TRAIN TRACKS, EXHAUSTED FROM HUNGER. HE WOKE UP AS A TRAIN RAN OVER HIS LIMBS. HE THEN INTO ART MULTIPLE AMPUTATIONS -- HE THEN INJURED MULTIPLE AMPUTATIONS WITHOUT ANYTHING TO DULL THE PAIN. HIS BROTHER AND SISTER AVA WHAT LITTLE FOOD THEY HAD TO HELP HIM RECOVER AND EIGHT DIRT -- ATE DIRT, THEMSELVES. LATER HE WAS TORTURED AFTER A BRIEF IS IT, RETURNING FROM CHINA. HIS TORMENTORS WANTED TO KNOW IF HE HAD MET ANY CHRISTIANS. HE HAD AND HE RESOLVED AFTER THAT TO BE FREE. SUNG HO TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES ON CRUTCHES ALL ACROSS CHINA AND SOUTH EAST ASIA TO FREEDOM. MOST OF HIS FAMILY FOLLOWED. HIS FATHER WAS CAUGHT TRYING TO ESCAPE AND WAS TORTURED TO DEATH. TODAY HE LIVES IN SEOUL, WHERE HE RESCUES OTHER  DEFECTORS. TODAY HE HAS A NEW LEG, BUT SUNG HO, I UNDERSTAND YOU STILL KEEP THOSE OLD CRUTCHES AS A REMINDER OF HOW FAR YOU HAVE COME. YOUR GREAT SACRIFICE IS AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL. PLEASE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SUNG HO'S STORY IS THE TESTAMENT OF EVERYONE TO LIVE IN FREEDOM. IT WAS THE SAME YEARNING FOR FREEDOM THAT GAVE BIRTH TO A SPECIAL PLACE CALLED AMERICA. IT WAS A SMALL CLUSTER OF COLONIES CAUGHT BETWEEN A GREAT OCEAN AND A VAST WILDERNESS. IT WAS HOME TO AN INCREDIBLE PEOPLE COME WITH A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA THAT THEY COULD RULE THEMSELVES. THAT THEY COULD CHART THEIR OWN DESTINY AND THAT TOGETHER THEY COULD LIGHT UP THE ENTIRE WORLD. THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS STOOD FOR, ALWAYS STRIVED FOR, AND ALWAYS DONE. ATOP THE DOME OF THIS CAPITAL STANDS THE STATUE OF FREEDOM. SHE STANDS TALL AND DIGNIFIED AMONG THE MONUMENTS TO OUR ANCESTORS, WHO FOUGHT AND LIVED AND DIED TO PROTECT HER. MONUMENTS TO WASHINGTON, AND JEFFERSON, AND LINCOLN, AND KING. MEMORIALS TO THE HEROES OF YORKTOWN, AND SARATOGA. TWO YOUNG AMERICANS WHO SHED THEIR BLOOD ON THE SHORES OF NORMANDY AND THE FIELDS BEYOND, AND OTHERS WHO WENT DOWN IN THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC AND THE SKIES ALL OVER ASIA. FREEDOM STANDS TALL OVER ONE MORE MONUMENT. THIS ONE. THIS CAPITOL. THIS LIVING MONUMENT. THIS IS THE MONUMENT TO THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ARE A PEOPLE WHO SE HEROES LIVE NOT ONLY IN THE PAST, BUT ALL AROUND US, DEFENDING HOPE, PRIDE, AND DEFENDING THE AMERICAN WAY. THEY WORK IN EVERY TRADE, THEY SACRIFICE TO RAISE A FAMILY. THEY CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN AT HOME. THEY DEFEND OUR FLAG ABROAD. THEY ARE STRONG MOMS AND BRAVE KIDS. THEY ARE FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICER'S AND BORDER AGENTS, MEDICS, AND MARINES. ABOVE ALL ELSE, THEY ARE AMERICANS. THIS CAPITAL, THE CITY, THIS NATION, BELONGS ENTIRELY TO THEM. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: OUR TASK IS TO RESPECT THEM, TO LISTEN TO THEM, TO SERVE THEM, TO PROTECT THEM, AND TO ALWAYS BE WORTHY OF THEM. AMERICANS FILL WORLD WITH ARDENT MUSIC. THEY PUSH THE BALANCE OF SCIENCE AND DISCOVERY. THEY FOREVER REMIND US OF WHAT WE SHOULD NEVER EVER FORGET. THE PEOPLE DREAMED THIS COUNTRY. THE PEOPLE DON'T THIS COUNTRY. IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS LONG AS WE ARE PROUD OF WHO WE ARE, AND WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR, THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT ACHIEVE. AS LONG AS WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OUR VALUES, FAITH IN OUR CITIZENS, AND TRUST IN OUR GOD, WE WILL NEVER FAIL. OUR FAMILIES WILL THRIVE. OUR PEOPLE WILL PROSPER, AND OUR NATION WILL FOREVER BE SAFE AND STRONG, AND PROUD, AND MIGHTY, AND FREE. THANK YOU, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. GOOD NIGHT. [APPLAUSE] >> [CROWD CHANTING USA] [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. >> GREAT JOB. GREAT JOB. >> WELL DONE. PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU. >> KING OF NEW YORK. >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. PRES. TRUMP: HOW'S IT GOING? GET IT DONE. >> GOOD JOB. >> AWESOME. >> WE GOT YOUR BACK, SIR. PRES. TRUMP: THANKS. THANK YOU, FELLAS. MS. PELOSI: THE ASSOCIATE JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT. [APPLAUSE] [INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER] [APPLAUSE] [INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER] >> MADAM SPEAKER, THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET. [APPLAUSE] [INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER] [APPLAUSE] >> MADAM SPEAKER, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER] [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER, VICE PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THE FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS. WE MEET TONIGHT AT A MOMENT OF UNLIMITED POTENTIAL, AS WE BEGIN A NEW CONGRESS, I STAND HERE READY TO WORK WITH YOU TO ACHIEVE HISTORIC BREAKTHROUGHS FOR ALL AMERICANS. MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS ARE WATCHING US, GATHERED IN THIS GREAT CHAMBER, HOPING WE WILL GOVERN NOT AS TWO PARTIES, BUT AS ONE NATION. [APPLAUSE] THE AGENDA I WILL LAY OUT THIS EVENING IS NOT A REPUBLICAN AGENDA OR DEMOCRAT AGENDA, IT IS THE AGENDA OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. MANY OF US HAVE CAMPAIGNED ON THE SAME CORE PROMISES, TO DEFEND AMERICAN JOBS AND DEMAND FAIR TRADE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS, TO REBUILD AND REVITALIZE OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE, TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, TO CREATE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT IS SAFE, LAWFUL, MODERN AND SECURE, AND TO PURSUE A FOREIGN POLICY THAT PUTS AMERICA'S INTERESTS FIRST. THERE IS A NEW OPPORTUNITY IN AMERICAN POLITICS, IF ONLY WE HAVE THE COURAGE TOGETHER TO SEIZE IT. [APPLAUSE] VICTORY IS NOT WINNING FOR OUR PARTY, VICTORY IS WINNING FOR OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THIS YEAR, AMERICA WILL RECOGNIZE TWO IMPORTANT ANNIVERSARIES THAT SHOW US THE MAJESTY OF AMERICA'S VISION AND THE POWER OF AMERICAN PRIDE. IN JUNE WE MARKED 75 YEARS SINCE THE START OF WHAT GENERAL DWIGHT D EISENHOWER CALLED "THE GREAT CRUSADE," THE ALLIED LIBERATION OF EUROPE IN WORLD WAR II. [APPLAUSE] ON D-DAY, JUNE 6, 1944, 15,000 YOUNG AMERICAN MEN JUMPED FROM THE SKIES, AND 60,000 MORE STORMED IN FROM THE SEA TO SAVE OUR CIVILIZATION FROM TYRANNY. HERE WITH US TONIGHT ARE THREE OF THOSE INCREDIBLE HEROES. PRIVATE FIRST CLASS JOSEPH RILEY, STAFF SERGEANT ERVING WALKER -- AND SERGEANT HARTMAN ZEITCHECK. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: GENTLEMEN, WE SALUTE YOU. IN 2019 WE ALSO CELEBRATE 50 YEARS SINCE BRAVE YOUNG PILOTS FLEW 1/4 OF ONE MILLION MILES THROUGH SPACE THE PLANTS OF AMERICAN FLAG ON THE FACE OF THE MOON. HALF A CENTURY LATER, WE ARE JOINED BY ONE OF THE APOLLO 11 ASTRONAUTS WHO PLANTED THAT FLAG, BUZZ ALDRIN. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, BUZZ. THIS YEAR, AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS WILL GO BACK TO SPACE IN AMERICAN ROCKETS. [APPLAUSE] IN THE 20TH CENTURY, AMERICA SAVED FREEDOM, TRANSFORMED SCIENCE, REDEFINED THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT, THERE IS NOTHING ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT CAN COMPETE WITH AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] NOW WE MUST STEP BOLDLY AND BRAVELY INTO THE NEXT CHAPTER OF THIS GREAT AMERICAN ADVENTURE. WE MUST CREATE A NEW STANDARD OF LIVING FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. AN AMAZING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL OF OUR CITIZENS IS WITHIN REACH. WE CAN MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER, OUR FAMILIES STRONGER, OUR CULTURE RICHER, OUR FAITH DEEPER, AND OUR MIDDLE CLASS AND MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] BUT WE MUST REJECT THE POLITICS OF REVENGE, RESISTANCE AND RETRIBUTION, AND EMBRACE THE BOUNDLESS POTENTIAL OF COOPERATION, COMPROMISE, AND THE COMMON GOOD. [APPLAUSE] TOGETHER WE CAN BREAK DECADES OF POLITICAL STALEMATE. WE CAN BRIDGE ALL DIVISIONS, HEAL OLD WOUNDS, BUILD NEW COALITIONS, FORGE NEW SOLUTIONS, AND UNLOCK THE EXTRAORDINARY PROMISE OF AMERICA'S FUTURE. THE DECISION IS OURS TO MAKE. WE MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN GREATNESS OR GRIDLOCK, RESULTS OR RESISTANCE, VISION OR VENGEANCE, INCREDIBLE PROGRESS OR POINTLESS DESTRUCTION. TONIGHT, I ASK YOU TO CHOOSE GREATNESS. [APPLAUSE] OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, MY ADMINISTRATION HAS MOVED WITH A URGENCY AND HISTORIC SPEED TO CONFRONT PROBLEMS NEGLECTED BY LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES OVER MANY DECADES. IN JUST OVER TWO YEARS SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE LAUNCHED AN UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC BOOM, A BOOM THAT HAS RARELY BEEN SEEN BEFORE. THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING LIKE IT. WE HAVE CREATED 5.3 MILLION NEW JOBS, AND IMPORTANTLY, ADDED 600,000 NEW MANUFACTURING JOBS, SOMETHING WHICH ALMOST EVERYONE SAID WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO, BUT THE FACT IS, WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. [APPLAUSE] WAGES ARE RISING AT THE FASTEST PACE IN DECADES, AND GROWING FOR BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS, WHO I PROMISE TO FIGHT FOR. THEY ARE GROWING FASTER THAN ANYONE ELSE. NEARLY 5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF FOOD STAMPS. [APPLAUSE] THE U.S. ECONOMY IS GROWING ALMOST TWICE AS FAST TODAY AS WHEN I TOOK OFFICE, AND WE ARE CONSIDERED FAR AND AWAY THE HOTTEST ECONOMY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. NOT EVEN CLOSE. [APPLAUSE] UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE IN OVER HALF A CENTURY. [APPLAUSE] AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN, AND ASIAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE ALL REACHED THEIR LOWEST LEVELS EVER RECORDED. [APPLAUSE] UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES HAS ALSO REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW. [APPLAUSE] MORE PEOPLE ARE WORKING NOW THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 157 MILLION PEOPLE AT WORK. WE PASSED A MASSIVE TAX CUT FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND DOUBLE THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE VIRTUALLY ENDED THE ESTATE TAX, OR DEATH TAX THAT IS -- AS IT IS CALLED, FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, RANCHES AND FAMILY FARMS. [APPLAUSE] WE ELIMINATED THE VERY UNPOPULAR OBAMACARE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY. [APPLAUSE] AND TO GIVE CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS ACCESS TO LIFE-SAVING CURES, WE PASSED VERY IMPORTANTLY, RIGHT TO TRY. [APPLAUSE] MY ADMINISTRATION HAS CUT MORE REGULATIONS IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAN ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATION DURING ITS ENTIRE TENURE. [APPLAUSE] COMPANIES ARE COMING BACK TO OUR COUNTRY IN LARGE NUMBERS, THANKS TO OUR HISTORIC REDUCTIONS IN TAXES AND REGULATIONS. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE UNLEASHED A REVOLUTION IN AMERICAN ENERGY. THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] AND NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 65 YEARS, WE ARE A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY. [APPLAUSE] AFTER 24 MONTHS OF RAPID PROGRESS, OUR ECONOMY IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. OUR MILITARY IS THE MOST POWERFUL ON EARTH, BY FAR, AND AMERICA -- [APPLAUSE] AMERICA IS AGAIN WINNING EACH AND EVERY DAY. [APPLAUSE] MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS STRONG. [APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING USA] PRES. TRUMP: THAT SOUNDS SO GOOD. [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: OUR COUNTRY IS VIBRANT AND OUR ECONOMY IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. FRIDAY IT WAS ANNOUNCED WE ADDED ANOTHER 304,000 JOBS LAST MONTH ALONE, ALMOST DOUBLE THE NUMBER EXPECTED. [APPLAUSE] AN ECONOMIC MIRACLE IS TAKING PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP IT ARE FOOLISH WARS, POLITICS, OR RIDICULOUS, PARTISAN INVESTIGATIONS. [APPLAUSE] IF THERE IS GOING TO BE PEACE IN LEGISLATION, THERE CANNOT BE WAR AND INVESTIGATION. IT JUST DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. WE MUST BE UNITED AT HOME TO DEFEAT OUR ADVERSARIES ABROAD. THIS NEW ERA OF COOPERATION CAN START WITH FINALLY CONFIRMING THE MORE THAN 300 HIGHLY QUALIFIED NOMINEES WHO ARE STILL STUCK IN THE SENATE, IN SOME CASES YEARS AND YEARS WAITING -- NOT RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THE SENATE HAS FAILED TO ACT ON THESE NOMINATIONS, WHICH IS UNFAIR TO THE NOMINEES, AND VERY UNFAIR TO OUR COUNTRY. NOW IS THE TIME FOR BIPARTISAN ACTION. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WE HAVE ALREADY PROVEN THAT IS POSSIBLE. IN THE LAST CONGRESS, BOTH PARTIES CAME TOGETHER TO PASS UNPRECEDENTED LEGISLATION TO CONFRONT THE OPIOID CRISIS, A SWEEPING NEW FARM BILL, HISTORIC V.A. REFORMS, AND AFTER FOUR DECADES OF REJECTION, WE PASSED A V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY, SO WE CAN FINALLY TERMINATE THOSE WHO MISTREAT OUR WONDERFUL VETERANS. [APPLAUSE] AND JUST WEEKS AGO, ALL PARTIES UNITED FOR GROUNDBREAKING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE. [APPLAUSE] LAST YEAR, I HEARD THROUGH FRIENDS, THE STORY OF ALICE JOHNSON. I WAS DEEPLY MOVED. IN 1997, ALICE WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON AS A FIRST TIME, NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENDER. OVER THE NEXT 22 YEARS, SHE BECAME A PRISON MINISTER, INSPIRING OTHERS TO CHOOSE A BETTER PATH. SHE HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THAT PRISON POPULATION AND FAR BEYOND. ALICE'S STORY UNDERSCORES THE DISPARITIES AND UNFAIRNESS THAT CAN EXIST IN CRIMINAL SENTENCING, AND THE NEED TO REMEDY THIS TOTAL INJUSTICE. SHE SERVED ALMOST THAT 22 YEARS, AND HAD EXPECTED TO BE IN PRISON FOR THE REMAINDER OF HER LIFE. IN JUNE, I COMMUTED ALICE'S SENTENCE. WHEN I SAW ALICE'S BEAUTIFUL FAMILY GREET HER AT THE PRISON GATES, HUGGING AND KISSING AND CRYING AND LAUGHING, I KNEW I DID SOMETHING RIGHT. ALICE IS WITH US TONIGHT, AND SHE IS A TERRIFIC WOMAN. TERRIFIC. ALICE, PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ALICE, THANK YOU FOR REMINDING US THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE THAT HOWARD TO SHAPE -- THE POWER TO SHAPE OUR OWN DESTINY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: INSPIRED BY STORIES LIKE ALICE'S, MY ADMINISTRATION WORKED CLOSELY WITH MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES TO SIGN THE FIRST STEP ACT INTO LAW. BIG DEAL. THAT IS A BIG DEAL. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THIS LEGISLATION REFORMED SENTENCING LAWS THAT HAVE WRONGLY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THE FIRST STEP ACT GIVES NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS THE CHANCE TO REENTER SOCIETY AS PRODUCTIVE, LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. NOW, STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE FOLLOWING OUR LEAD. AMERICA IS A NATION THAT BELIEVES IN REDEMPTION. WE ARE ALSO JOINED TONIGHT BY MATTHEW CHARLES FROM TENNESSEE. IN 1996, AT THE AGE OF 30, MATTHEW WAS SENTENCED TO 35 YEARS FOR SELLING DRUGS AND RELATED OFFENSES. OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES, HE COMPLETED MORE THAN 30 BIBLE STUDIES, BECAME A LAW CLERK, AND MENTORED MANY OF HIS FELLOW INMATES. NOW, MATTHEW WAS THE VERY FIRST PERSON TO BE RELEASED FROM PRISON UNDER THE FIRST STEP ACT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MATTHEW, PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU, MATTHEW. WELCOME HOME. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: NOW, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS MUST JOIN FORCES AGAIN TO CONFRONT AN URGENT NATIONAL CRISIS. CONGRESS HAS 10 DAYS LEFT TO PASS A BILL THAT WILL FUND OUR GOVERNMENT, PROTECT OUR HOMELAND, AND SECURE ARE VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER. NOW IS THE TIME FOR CONGRESS TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT AMERICA IS COMMITTED TO ENDING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND PUTTING THE RUTHLESS COYOTES, CARTELS, DRUG DEALERS, AND HUMAN TRAFFICKERS OUT OF BUSINESS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS WE SPEAK, LARGE, ORGANIZED CARAVANS ARE ON THE MARCH TO THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE JUST HEARD THAT MEXICAN CITIES, IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES, ARE GETTING TRUCKS AND BUSES TO BRING THEM UP TO OUR COUNTRY IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS LITTLE BORDER PROTECTION. I HAVE ORDERED ANOTHER 3750 TROOPS TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDER TO PREPARE FOR THIS TREMENDOUS ONSLAUGHT. THIS IS A MORAL ISSUE. THE LAWLESS STATE OF OUR SOUTHERN BORDER IS A THREAT TO THE SAFETY, SECURITY, AND FINANCIAL WELL-BEING OF ALL AMERICANS. WE HAVE A MORAL DUTY TO CREATE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS THE LIVES AND JOBS OF OUR CITIZENS. THIS INCLUDES OUR OBLIGATION TO THE MILLIONS OF IMMIGRANTS LIVING HERE TODAY WHO FOLLOW THE RULES AND RESPECTED OUR LAWS. LEGAL IMMIGRANTS ENRICH OUR NATION AND STRENGTHEN OUR SOCIETY IN COUNTLESS WAYS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY IN THE LARGEST NUMBERS EVER, BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TONIGHT, I'M ASKING YOU TO DEFEND ARE VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER OUT OF LOVE AND DEVOTION TO OUR FELLOW CITIZENS AND OUR COUNTRY. NO ISSUE BETTER ILLUSTRATES THE DIVIDE BETWEEN AMERICA'S WORKING-CLASS AND AMERICA'S POLITICAL CLASS THAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WEALTHY POLITICIANS AND DONORS PUSH FOR OPEN BORDERS, WHILE LIVING THEIR LIVES BEHIND WALLS AND GATES AND GUARDS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MEANWHILE, WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS ARE LEFT TO PAY THE PRICE FOR MASS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, REDUCED TO JOBS, LOWER WAGES, OVERBURDENED SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS THAT ARE SO CROWDED YOU CAN'T GET IN, INCREASED CRIME, AND A DEPLETED SOCIAL SAFETY NET. TOLERANCE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS NOT COMPASSIONATE, IT IS ACTUALLY VERY CRUEL. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ONE IN THREE WOMEN IS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON THE LONG JOURNEY NORTH. SMUGGLERS USE MIGRANT CHILDREN AS HUMAN PAWNS TO EXPLOIT OUR LAWS AND GAIN ACCESS TO OUR COUNTRY. HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AND SEX TRAFFICKERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WIDE-OPEN AREAS BETWEEN OUR PORTS OF ENTRY TO SMUGGLE THOUSANDS OF YOUNG GIRLS AND WOMEN INTO THE UNITED STATES AND TO SELL THEM INTO PROSTITUTION AND MODERN-DAY SLAVERY. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT AMERICANS ARE KILLED BY LETHAL DRUGS THAT CROSS OUR BORDER AND FLOOD INTO OUR CITIES, INCLUDING METH, HEROIN, COCAINE, AND FENTANYL. THE SAVAGE GANG MS 13 NOW OPERATES IN AT LEAST 20 DIFFERENT AMERICAN STATES AND THEY ALMOST ALL COME THROUGH OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. JUST YESTERDAY, AN MS-13 GANG MEMBER WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY FOR A FATAL SHOOTING ON A SUBWAY PLATFORM IN NEW YORK CITY. WE ARE REMOVING THESE GANG MEMBERS BY THE THOUSANDS, BUT UNTIL WE SECURE OUR BORDER, THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP STREAMING RIGHT BACK IN. YEAR AFTER YEAR, COUNTLESS AMERICANS ARE MURDERED BY CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS. I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW MANY WONDERFUL ANGEL MOMS AND DADS AND FAMILIES. NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO SUFFER THE HORRIBLE HEARTACHE THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO ENDURE. HERE TONIGHT IS DEBORAH BISSELL, JUST THREE WEEKS AGO HER PARENTS WERE BURGLARIZED AND SHOT TO DEATH IN THEIR RENO, NEVADA, HOME BY AN ILLEGAL ALIEN. THEY WERE IN THEIR 80'S AND ARE SURVIVED BY FOUR CHILDREN, 11 GRANDCHILDREN, AND 20 GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN. ALSO HERE TONIGHT ARE GERALD AND SHARON'S GRANDDAUGHTER HEATHER AND GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER MADISON. TO DEBROAH, HEATHER, MADISON, PLEASE STAND. FEW CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR PAIN. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I WILL NEVER FORGET AND I WILL FIGHT FOR THE MEMORY OF GERALD AND SHARON, THAT IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. NOT ONE MORE AMERICAN LIFE SHOULD BE LOST BECAUSE OUR NATION FAILED TO CONTROL IT'S VERY DANGEROUS BORDER. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, OUR BRAVE ICE OFFICERS MADE 266,000 ARRESTS OF CRIMINAL ALIENS, INCLUDING THOSE CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF NEARLY 100,000 ASSAULTS. 30,000 SEX CRIMES, AND 4000 KILLINGS OR MURDERS. WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT BY ONE OF THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT HEROES, ICE SPECIAL AGENT ELVIN HERNANDEZ. [LAUGHTER] -- [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU. WELL ELVIN WAS A BOY, THE END HIS FAMILY LEGALLY IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES FROM THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. AT THE AGE OF EIGHT, HE TOLD HIS DAD HE WANTED TO BECOME A SPECIAL AGENT. TODAY, HE LEADS INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE SCORES OF INTERNATIONAL SEX TRAFFICKING. HE SAYS THAT IF I CAN MAKE SURE THESE YOUNG GIRLS GET THEIR JUSTICE, I'VE REALLY DONE MY JOB. THANKS TO HIS WORK WORK AND THAF HIS INCREDIBLE COLLEAGUES, MORE THAN 300 WOMEN AND GIRLS HAVE BEEN RESCUED FROM THE HORROR OF THIS TERRIBLE SITUATION AND MORE THAN 1500 SADISTIC TRAFFICKERS HAVE BEEN PUT BEHIND BARS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I PLEDGE TO YOU TONIGHT THAT I WILL NEVER ABOLISH OUR HEROES FROM ICE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MY ADMINISTRATION HAS SENT TO THE CONGRESS A COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL TO END THE CRISIS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. IT INCLUDES HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT, DRUG DETECTION AT OUR PORTS, CLOSING LOOPHOLES THAT ENABLE CHILD SMUGGLING, AND PLANS FOR A NEW PHYSICAL BARRIER, OR WALL, TO SECURE THE VAST AREAS BETWEEN OUR PORTS OF ENTRY. IN THE PAST, MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM VOTED FOR A WALL -- BUT THE PROPER WALL NEVER GOT BUILT. I'LL GET IT BUILT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THIS IS A SMART, STRATEGIC, SEE-THROUGH STEEL BARRIER -- NOT JUST A SIMPLE CONCRETE WALL. IT WILL BE DEPLOYED IN THE AREAS IDENTIFIED BY BORDER AGENTS AS HAVING THE GREATEST NEED, AND AS THESE AGENTS WILL TELL YOU, WHERE WALLS GO UP, ILLEGAL CROSSINGS GO WAY DOWN. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SAN DIEGO USED TO HAVE THE MOST ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS IN THE COUNTRY. IN RESPONSE, A STRONG SECURITY WALL WAS PUT IN PLACE. THIS POWERFUL BARRIER ALMOST COMPLETELY ENDED ILLEGAL CROSSINGS. THE BORDER CITY OF EL PASO, TEXAS, USED TO HAVE EXTREMELY HIGH RATES OF VIOLENT CRIME -- ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY, AND CONSIDERED ONE OF OUR NATION'S MOST DANGEROUS CITIES. NOW, IMMEDIATELY UPON ITS BUILDING, WITH A POWERFUL BARRIER IN PLACE, EL PASO IS ONE OF OUR SAFEST CITIES. SIMPLY PUT, WALLS WORK AND WALLS SAVE LIVES. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SO LET'S WORK TOGETHER, COMPROMISE, AND REACH A DEAL THAT WILL TRULY MAKE AMERICA SAFE. AS WE WORK TO DEFEND OUR PEOPLE'S SAFETY, WE MUST ALSO ENSURE OUR ECONOMIC RESURGENCE CONTINUES AT A RAPID PACE. NO ONE HAS BENEFITTED MORE FROM OUR THRIVING ECONOMY THAN WOMEN, WHO HAVE FILLED 58% OF THE NEW JOBS CREATED IN THE LAST YEAR. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: YOU WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL AMERICANS CAN BE PROUD THAT WE HAVE MORE WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE THAN EVER BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: DON'T SIT YET. YOU ARE GOING TO LIKE THIS. [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: AND EXACTLY ONE CENTURY AFTER THE CONGRESS PASSED THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT GIVING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE, WE ALSO HAVE MORE WOMEN SERVING IN THE CONGRESS THAN EVER BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING "U.S.A."] [GENERAL CHATTER] PRES. TRUMP: THAT'S GREAT. [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: VERY GREAT. AND CONGRATULATIONS. THAT'S GREAT. AS PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE, THIS THURSDAY WE ARE LAUNCHING THE FIRST EVER GOVERNMENT-WIDE INITIATIVE FOCUSED ON ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT FOR WOMEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TO BUILD ON OUR INCREDIBLE ECONOMIC SUCCESS, ONE PRIORITY IS PARAMOUNT -- REVERSING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES. SO BAD. WE ARE NOW MAKING IT CLEAR TO CHINA THAT AFTER YEARS OF TARGETING OUR INDUSTRIES, AND STEALING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THE THEFT OF AMERICAN JOBS AND WEALTH HAS COME TO AN END. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THEREFORE, WE RECENTLY IMPOSED TARIFFS ON $250 BILLION OF CHINESE GOODS -- AND NOW OUR TREASURY IS RECEIVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A MONTH FROM -- BUT I DON'T BLAME CHINA FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US. I BLAME OUR LEADERS AND REPRESENTATIVES FOR ALLOWING THIS TRAVESTY TO HAPPEN. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT XI, AND WE ARE NOW WORKING ON A NEW TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA. BUT IT MUST INCLUDE REAL, STRUCTURAL CHANGE TO END UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES, REDUCE OUR CHRONIC TRADE DEFICIT, AND PROTECT AMERICAN JOBS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ANOTHER HISTORIC TRADE BLUNDER WAS THE CATASTROPHE KNOWN AS NAFTA. I HAVE MET THE MEN AND WOMEN OF MICHIGAN, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, INDIANA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND MANY OTHER STATES WHOSE DREAMS WERE SHATTERED BY NAFTA. FOR YEARS, POLITICIANS PROMISED THEM THEY WOULD NEGOTIATE FOR A BETTER DEAL. BUT NO ONE EVER TRIED -- UNTIL NOW. OUR NEW U.S.-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT -- OR USMCA -- WILL REPLACE NAFTA AND DELIVER FOR AMERICAN WORKERS LIKE THEY HAVE NOT HAD DELIVERED TO FOR A LONG TIME. I HOPE YOU CAN PASS THE USMCA INTO LAW SO WE CAN BRING BACK OUR MANUFACTURING JOBS IN GREATER NUMBERS, EXPAND AMERICAN AGRICULTURE, PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND ENSURE THAT MORE CARS ARE PROUDLY STAMPED WITH FOUR BEAUTIFUL WORDS -- MADE IN THE USA. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TONIGHT, I AM ALSO ASKING YOU TO PASS THE UNITED STATES RECIPROCAL TRADE ACT, SO THAT IF ANOTHER COUNTRY PLACES AN UNFAIR TARIFF ON AN AMERICAN PRODUCT, WE CAN CHARGE THEM THE EXACT SAME TARIFF ON THE SAME PRODUCT THAT THEY SELL TO US. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: BOTH PARTIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNITE FOR A GREAT REBUILDING OF AMERICA'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I KNOW THAT THE CONGRESS IS EAGER TO PASS AN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL -- AND I AM EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU ON LEGISLATION TO DELIVER NEW AND IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN THE CUTTING EDGE INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE. THIS IS NOT AN OPTION. THIS IS A NECESSITY. THE NEXT MAJOR PRIORITY FOR ME, AND FOR ALL OF US, SHOULD BE TO LOWER THE COST OF HEALTHCARE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS -- AND TO PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ALREADY, AS A RESULT OF MY ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS, IN 2018 DRUG PRICES EXPERIENCED THEIR SINGLE LARGEST DECLINE IN 46 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: BUT WE MUST DO MORE. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT AMERICANS PAY VASTLY MORE THAN PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THE EXACT SAME DRUGS, OFTEN MADE IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE. THIS IS WRONG, UNFAIR, AND TOGETHER WE CAN STOP IT. AND WE WILL STOP IT FAST. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I AM ASKING THE CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT FINALLY TAKES ON THE PROBLEM OF GLOBAL FREELOADING AND DELIVERS FAIRNESS AND PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR AMERICAN PATIENTS. FINALLY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE SHOULD ALSO REQUIRE DRUG COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND HOSPITALS TO DISCLOSE REAL PRICES TO FOSTER COMPETITION AND BRING COSTS DOWN. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: NO FORCE IN HISTORY HAS DONE MORE TO ADVANCE THE HUMAN CONDITION THAN AMERICAN FREEDOM. IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE MADE REMARKABLE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV AND AIDS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE MADE REMARKABLE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV AND AIDS. SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS HAVE BROUGHT A ONCE-DISTANT DREAM WITHIN REACH. MY BUDGET WILL ASK DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO MAKE THE NEEDED COMMITMENT TO ELIMINATE THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE UNITED STATES WITHIN 10 YEARS. WE HAVE MADE INCREDIBLE STRIDES. INCREDIBLE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TOGETHER, WE WILL DEFEAT AIDS IN AMERICA. AND BEYOND. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TONIGHT, I AM ALSO ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME IN ANOTHER FIGHT THAT ALL AMERICANS CAN GET BEHIND -- THE FIGHT AGAINST CHILDHOOD CANCER. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: JOINING MELANIA IN THE GALLERY THIS EVENING IS A VERY BRAVE 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL, GRACE ELINE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: HI, GRACE. [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: EVERY BIRTHDAY SINCE SHE WAS 4, GRACE ASKED HER FRIENDS TO DONATE TO ST. JUDE CHILDREN'S RESEARCH HOSPITAL. SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT ONE DAY SHE MIGHT BE A PATIENT HERSELF. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. LAST YEAR, GRACE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN CANCER. IMMEDIATELY, SHE BEGAN RADIATION TREATMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, SHE RALLIED HER COMMUNITY AND RAISED MORE THAN $40,000 FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST CANCER. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WHEN GRACE COMPLETED TREATMENT LAST FALL, HER DOCTORS AND NURSES CHEERED -- THEY LOVE TO HER, THEY STILL LOVE HER. WITH TEARS IN THEIR EYES AS SHE HUNG UP A POSTER THAT READ, "LAST DAY OF CHEMO."  [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU, GRACE. YOU ARE A GREAT INSPIRATION TO EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MANY CHILDHOOD CANCERS HAVE NOT SEEN NEW THERAPIES IN DECADES. MY BUDGET WILL ASK THE CONGRESS FOR $500 MILLION OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS TO FUND THIS CRITICAL LIFE-SAVING RESEARCH. TO HELP SUPPORT WORKING PARENTS, THE TIME HAS COME TO PASS SCHOOL CHOICE FOR AMERICA'S CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I AM ALSO PROUD TO BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO INCLUDE IN MY BUDGET A PLAN FOR NATIONWIDE PAID FAMILY LEAVE -- SO THAT EVERY NEW PARENT HAS THE CHANCE TO BOND WITH THEIR NEWBORN CHILD. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THERE COULD BE NO GREATER CONTRAST TO THE BEAUTIFUL IMAGE OF A MOTHER HOLDING HER INFANT CHILD THAN THE CHILLING DISPLAYS OUR NATION SAW IN RECENT DAYS. LAWMAKERS IN NEW YORK CHEERED WITH DELIGHT UPON THE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW A BABY TO BE RIPPED FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB MOMENTS BEFORE BIRTH. THESE ARE LIVING, FEELING, BEAUTIFUL BABIES WHO WILL NEVER GET THE CHANCE TO SHARE THEIR LOVE AND DREAMS WITH THE WORLD. AND THEN, WE HAD THE CASE OF THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA WHERE HE STATED HE WOULD EXECUTE A BABY AFTER BIRTH. TO DEFEND THE DIGNITY OF EVERY PERSON, I AM ASKING THE CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION TO PROHIBIT THE LATE-TERM ABORTION OF CHILDREN WHO CAN FEEL PAIN IN THE MOTHER'S WOMB. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: LET US WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD A CULTURE THAT CHERISHES INNOCENT LIFE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND LET US REAFFIRM A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH -- ALL CHILDREN -- BORN AND UNBORN -- ARE MADE IN THE HOLY IMAGE OF GOD. THE FINAL PART OF MY AGENDA IS TO PROTECT AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY. OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS, WE HAVE BEGUN TO FULLY REBUILD THE UNITED STATES MILITARY -- WITH $700 BILLION LAST YEAR AND $716 BILLION THIS YEAR. WE ARE ALSO GETTING OTHER NATIONS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: FINALLY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: FOR YEARS, THE UNITED STATES WAS BEING TREATED VERY UNFAIRLY BY FRIENDS OF OURS, BY MEMBERS OF NATO, BUT NOW WE HAVE SECURED A $100 BILLION INCREASE IN DEFENSE SPENDING FROM NATO ALLIES. THEY SAID IT COULD NOT BE DONE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS PART OF OUR MILITARY BUILD-UP, THE UNITED STATES IS DEVELOPING A STATE-OF-THE-ART MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR ADVANCING AMERICA'S INTERESTS. FOR EXAMPLE, DECADES AGO THE UNITED STATES ENTERED INTO A TREATY WITH RUSSIA IN WHICH WE AGREED TO LIMIT AND REDUCE OUR MISSILE CAPABILITIES. WHILE WE FOLLOWED THE AGREEMENT AND THE RULES TO THE LETTER, RUSSIA REPEATEDLY VIOLATED ITS TERMS. IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS. THAT IS WHY I ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS OFFICIALLY WITHDRAWING FROM THE INTERMEDIATE-RANGE NUCLEAR FORCES TREATY, OR INF TREATY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE. PERHAPS WE CAN NEGOTIATE A DIFFERENT AGREEMENT, ADDING CHINA AND OTHERS, OR PERHAPS WE CAN'T - IN WHICH CASE, WE WILL OUTSPEND AND OUT-INNOVATE ALL OTHERS BY FAR. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS PART OF A BOLD NEW DIPLOMACY, WE CONTINUE OUR HISTORIC PUSH FOR PEACE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. OUR HOSTAGES HAVE COME HOME, NUCLEAR TESTING HAS STOPPED, AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN A MISSILE LAUNCH IN 15 MONTHS. IF I HAD NOT BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WE WOULD RIGHT NOW, IN MY OPINION, BE IN A MAJOR WAR WITH NORTH KOREA. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MUCH WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE, BUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG UN IS A GOOD ONE. CHAIRMAN KIM AND I WILL MEET AGAIN ON FEBRUARY 27 AND 28 IN VIETNAM. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TWO WEEKS AGO, THE UNITED STATES OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA, AND ITS NEW INTERIM PRESIDENT, JUAN GUAIDO. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE STAND WITH THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE IN THEIR NOBLE QUEST FOR FREEDOM -- AND WE CONDEMN THE BRUTALITY OF THE MADURO REGIME, WHOSE SOCIALIST POLICIES HAVE TURNED THAT NATION FROM BEING THE WEALTHIEST IN SOUTH AMERICA INTO A STATE OF ABJECT POVERTY AND DESPAIR. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: HERE, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE ALARMED BY NEW CALLS TO ADOPT SOCIALISM IN OUR COUNTRY. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: AMERICA WAS FOUNDED ON LIBERTY AND INDEPENDENCE - NOT GOVERNMENT COERCION, DOMINATION, AND CONTROL. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ARE BORN FREE, AND WE WILL STAY FREE. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING "USA"] PRES. TRUMP: TONIGHT, WE RENEW OUR RESOLVE THAT AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING "USA"] PRES. TRUMP: ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX SET OF CHALLENGES WE FACE AND HAVE FOR MANY YEARS IS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. OUR APPROACH IS BASED ON PRINCIPLED REALISM -- NOT DISCREDITED THEORIES THAT HAVE FAILED FOR DECADES TO YIELD PROGRESS. FOR THIS REASON, MY ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZED THE TRUE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL -- AND PROUDLY OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: OUR BRAVE TROOPS HAVE NOW BEEN FIGHTING IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR ALMOST 19 YEARS. IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, NEARLY 7,000 AMERICAN HEROES HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES. MORE THAN 52,000 AMERICANS HAVE BEEN BADLY WOUNDED. WE HAVE SPENT MORE THAN $7 TRILLION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, I LOUDLY PLEDGED A NEW APPROACH. GREAT NATIONS DO NOT FIGHT ENDLESS WARS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WHEN I TOOK OFFICE, ISIS CONTROLLED MORE THAN 20,000 SQUARE MILES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. JUST TWO YEARS AGO. TODAY, WE HAVE LIBERATED VIRTUALLY ALL OF THAT TERRITORY FROM THE GRIP OF THESE BLOODTHIRSTY KILLERS. NOW, AS WE WORK WITH OUR ALLIES TO DESTROY THE REMNANTS OF ISIS, IT IS TIME TO GIVE OUR BRAVE WARRIORS IN SYRIA A WARM WELCOME HOME. I HAVE ALSO ACCELERATED OUR NEGOTIATIONS TO REACH A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN. THE OPPOSING SIDE IS ALSO VERY HAPPY TO BE NEGOTIATING. OUR TROOPS HAVE FOUGHT WITH UNMATCHED VALOR -- AND THANKS TO THEIR BRAVERY, WE ARE NOW ABLE TO PURSUE A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THIS LONG AND BLOODY CONFLICT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IN AFGHANISTAN, MY ADMINISTRATION IS HOLDING CONSTRUCTIVE TALKS WITH A NUMBER OF AFGHAN GROUPS, INCLUDING THE TALIBAN. AS WE MAKE PROGRESS IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR TROOP PRESENCE AND FOCUS ON COUNTER-TERRORISM. AND WE WILL INDEED FOCUS ON COUNTERTERRORISM. WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER WE WILL ACHIEVE AN AGREEMENT -- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT AFTER TWO DECADES OF WAR, THE HOUR HAS COME TO AT LEAST TRY FOR PEACE. AND THE OTHER SIDE WOULD LIKE TO DO THE SAME THING. IT IS TIME. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ABOVE ALL, FRIEND AND FOE ALIKE MUST NEVER DOUBT THIS NATION'S POWER AND WILL TO DEFEND OUR PEOPLE. 18 YEARS AGO, VIOLENT TERRORISTS ATTACKED THE USS COLE -- AND LAST MONTH AMERICAN FORCES KILLED ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE ATTACK. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ARE HONORED TO BE JOINED TONIGHT BY TOM WIBBERLEY, WHOSE SON, NAVY SEAMAN CRAIG WIBBERLEY, WAS ONE OF THE 17 SAILORS WE TRAGICALLY LOST. TOM, WE VOW TO ALWAYS REMEMBER THE HEROES OF THE USS COLE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ACTED DECISIVELY TO CONFRONT THE WORLD'S LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR -- THE RADICAL REGIME IN IRAN. IT IS A RADICAL REGIME. THEY DO BAD, BAD THINGS. TO ENSURE THIS CORRUPT DICTATORSHIP NEVER ACQUIRES NUCLEAR WEAPONS, I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND LAST FALL, WE PUT IN PLACE THE TOUGHEST SANCTIONS EVER IMPOSED ON A COUNTRY. WE WILL NOT AVERT OUR EYES FROM A REGIME THAT CHANTS DEATH TO AMERICA AND THREATENS GENOCIDE AGAINST THE JEWISH PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE MUST NEVER IGNORE THE VILE POISON OF ANTI-SEMITISM, OR THOSE WHO SPREAD ITS VENOMOUS CREED. WITH ONE VOICE, WE MUST CONFRONT THIS HATRED ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE IT OCCURS. JUST MONTHS AGO, 11 JEWISH-AMERICANS WERE VICIOUSLY MURDERED IN AN ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACK ON THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE IN PITTSBURGH. SWAT OFFICER TIMOTHY MATSON RACED INTO THE GUNFIRE AND WAS SHOT SEVEN TIMES CHASING DOWN THE KILLER. AND HE WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL. TIMOTHY HAS JUST HAD HIS 12TH SURGERY AND HE IS GOING IN FOR MANY MORE, BUT HE MADE THE TRIP TO BE HERE WITH US TONIGHT. OFFICER MATSON, PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU. WE ARE FOREVER GRATEFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TONIGHT, WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY PITTSBURGH SURVIVOR JUDAH SAMET. HE ARRIVED AT THE SYNAGOGUE AS THE MASSACRE BEGAN. BUT NOT ONLY DID JUDAH NARROWLY ESCAPE DEATH LAST FALL -- MORE THAN SEVEN DECADES AGO, HE NARROWLY SURVIVED THE NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMPS. TODAY IS JUDAH'S 81ST BIRTHDAY. [APPLAUSE] [GALLERY SINGS "HAPPY BIRTHDAY"] ♪ ♪ [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU! [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: THEY WOULD NOT DO THAT FOR ME, JUDAH. [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: JUDAH SAYS HE CAN STILL REMEMBER THE EXACT MOMENT, NEARLY 75 YEARS AGO, AFTER 10 MONTHS IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP, WHEN HE AND HIS FAMILY WERE PUT ON A TRAIN, AND TOLD THEY WERE GOING TO ANOTHER CAMP. SUDDENLY THE TRAIN SCREECHED TO A HALT. A SOLDIER APPEARED. JUDAH'S FAMILY BRACED FOR THE WORST. THEN, HIS FATHER CRIED OUT WITH JOY, "IT'S THE AMERICANS." [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU. A SECOND HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR WHO IS HERE TONIGHT, JOSHUA KAUFMAN, WAS A PRISONER AT DACHAU . HE REMEMBERS WATCHING THROUGH A HOLE IN THE WALL OF A CATTLE CAR AS AMERICAN SOLDIERS ROLLED IN WITH TANKS. "TO ME," JOSHUA RECALLS, "THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS WERE PROOF THAT GOD EXISTS, AND THEY CAME DOWN FROM THE SKY." THEY CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN. I BEGAN THIS EVENING BY HONORING THREE SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT ON D-DAY IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR. ONE OF THEM WAS HERMAN ZEITCHIK. BUT THERE IS MORE TO HERMAN'S STORY. A YEAR AFTER HE STORMED THE BEACHES OF NORMANDY, HERMAN WAS ONE OF THOSE AMERICAN SOLDIERS WHO HELPED LIBERATE DACHAU. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: HE WAS ONE OF THE AMERICANS WHO HELPED RESCUE JOSHUA FROM THAT HELL ON EARTH. ALMOST 75 YEARS LATER, HERMAN AND JOSHUA ARE BOTH TOGETHER IN THE GALLERY TONIGHT -- SEATED SIDE-BY-SIDE, HERE IN THE HOME OF AMERICAN FREEDOM. HERMAN AND JOSHUA, YOUR PRESENCE THIS EVENING IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU. WHEN AMERICAN SOLDIERS SET OUT BENEATH THE DARK SKIES OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IN THE EARLY HOURS OF D-DAY, 1944, THEY WERE JUST YOUNG MEN OF 18 AND 19, HURTLING ON FRAGILE LANDING CRAFT TOWARD THE MOST MOMENTOUS BATTLE IN THE HISTORY OF WAR. THEY DID NOT KNOW IF THEY WOULD SURVIVE THE HOUR. THEY DID NOT KNOW IF THEY WOULD GROW OLD. BUT THEY KNEW THAT AMERICA HAD TO PREVAIL. THEIR CAUSE WAS THIS NATION, AND GENERATIONS YET UNBORN. WHY DID THEY DO IT? THEY DID IT FOR AMERICA -- THEY DID IT FOR US. EVERYTHING THAT HAS COME SINCE -- OUR TRIUMPH OVER COMMUNISM, OUR GIANT LEAPS OF SCIENCE AND DISCOVERY, OUR UNRIVALED PROGRESS TOWARD EQUALITY AND JUSTICE -- ALL OF IT IS POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE BLOOD AND TEARS AND COURAGE AND VISION OF THE AMERICANS WHO CAME BEFORE. THINK OF THIS CAPITOL -- THINK OF THIS VERY CHAMBER, WHERE LAWMAKERS BEFORE YOU VOTED TO END SLAVERY, TO BUILD THE RAILROADS AND THE HIGHWAYS, TO DEFEAT FASCISM, TO SECURE CIVIL RIGHTS, TO FACE DOWN AN EVIL EMPIRE. HERE TONIGHT, WE HAVE LEGISLATORS FROM ACROSS THIS MAGNIFICENT REPUBLIC. YOU HAVE COME FROM THE ROCKY SHORES OF MAINE AND THE VOLCANIC PEAKS OF HAWAII, FROM THE SNOWY WOODS OF WISCONSIN AND THE RED DESERTS OF ARIZONA, FROM THE GREEN FARMS OF KENTUCKY AND THE GOLDEN BEACHES OF CALIFORNIA. TOGETHER, WE REPRESENT THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY NATION IN ALL OF HISTORY. WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THIS MOMENT? HOW WILL WE BE REMEMBERED? I ASK THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS CONGRESS, LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE US. OUR MOST THRILLING ACHIEVEMENTS ARE STILL AHEAD. OUR MOST EXCITING JOURNEYS STILL AWAIT. OUR BIGGEST VICTORIES ARE STILL TO COME. WE HAVE NOT YET BEGUN TO DREAM. WE MUST CHOOSE WHETHER WE ARE DEFINED BY OUR DIFFERENCES -- OR WHETHER WE DARE TO TRANSCEND THEM. WE MUST CHOOSE WHETHER WE WILL SQUANDER OUR INHERITANCE -- OR WHETHER WE WILL PROUDLY DECLARE THAT WE ARE AMERICANS. WE DO THE INCREDIBLE. WE DEFY THE IMPOSSIBLE. WE CONQUER THE UNKNOWN. THIS IS THE TIME TO RE-IGNITE THE AMERICAN IMAGINATION. THIS IS THE TIME TO SEARCH FOR THE TALLEST SUMMIT, AND SET OUR SIGHTS ON THE BRIGHTEST STAR. THIS IS THE TIME TO REKINDLE THE BONDS OF LOVE AND LOYALTY AND MEMORY THAT LINK US TOGETHER AS CITIZENS, AS NEIGHBORS, AS PATRIOTS. THIS IS OUR FUTURE -- OUR FATE -- AND OUR CHOICE TO MAKE. I AM ASKING YOU TO CHOOSE GREATNESS. NO MATTER THE TRIALS WE FACE, NO MATTER THE CHALLENGES TO COME, WE MUST GO FORWARD TOGETHER. WE MUST KEEP AMERICA FIRST IN OUR HEARTS. WE MUST KEEP FREEDOM ALIVE IN OUR SOULS. AND WE MUST ALWAYS KEEP FAITH IN AMERICA'S DESTINY -- THAT ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, MUST BE THE HOPE AND THE PROMISE AND THE LIGHT AND THE GLORY AMONG ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD! THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SPEAKER PELOSI THANKING THE  PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE, VICE  PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE, SEATED   BEHIND THE PRESIDENT OF HIS  STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS THAT  WAS SUPPOSED TO END ABOUT 9:55   EASTERN TIME.  IT ENDED AT 10:29. SO ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF  WHICH WOULD RANK UP THERE TO   THE SPEECH DELIVERED BACK IN   1995 BY PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON,  THE LONGEST STATE OF THE UNION   ADDRESS ON RECORD. COMING UP IN JUST A COUPLE   MINUTES, THE DEMOCRATIC  RESPONSE FROM STACEY ABRAMS WHO  WAS THE CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR   IN GEORGIA.  SHE LOST TO BRIAN KEMP.  OUR PHONE LINES ARE OPEN.  WE'LL GET TO YOUR CALLS AFTER  THE SPEECH.  WE'RE DIVIDING OUR PHONE LINES   FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORT OR OPPOSE  THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES.  WE'LL HAVE THE NUMBERS ON THE  SCREEN.  WE SHOULD POINT OUT THE  DESIGNATED SURVIVOR WAS RICK   PERRY, THE ENERGY SECRETARY. HE WAS NOT IN ATTENDANCE FOR   THIS SPEECH. THAT IS A TRADITION THAT DATES   BACK MANY YEARS IN WHICH ONE   PERSON IS NOT IN THE CAPITOL IN  THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHE   BECAUSE, OF COURSE, ALL LEVELS   OF GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE  PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT,   THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE,  MEMBERS OF THE CAB NATE, AND   THE SUPREME COURT IN --  CABINET, AND THE SUPREME COURT   IN ATTENDANCE. ENERGY SECRETARY NOT HERE  TONIGHT FOR THE PRESIDENT'S  STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.  THE HISTORY OF THE RESPONSES,  BY THE WAY, DATES BACK TO 1966   WHEN SENATOR DIRKSON,  REPUBLICAN OF ILLINOIS, AND  CONGRESSMAN JERRY FORD, WHO  WOULD GO ON TO BE PRESIDENT,   GAVE THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE TO  LYNDON JOHNSON'S SPEECH BACK IN  1966.  STACEY ABRAMS, WHO, BY THE WAY,  MADE HER FIRST APPEARANCE ON   C-SPAN BACK IN 1993, MARKING   THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  MARCH ON WASHINGTON, SHE NOW   WILL BE GIVING THE SPEECH AT   THE IBEW BUILDING IN ATLANTA,  GEORGIA. THERE WILL BE A CROWD GATHERED   AROUND HER.  HER SPEECH IS EXPECTED TO LAST   ABOUT 10 MINUTES.  SHE WILL SAY THE REPUBLICANS   HAVE RIGGED THE TAX SYSTEM   AGAINST WORKING AMERICANS. SO THE IBEW, THE LOCATION FOR  THE SPEECH.  THIS DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE FROM  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.  HIS SPEECH WHICH RAN ABOUT AN  HOUR AND A HALF. REMINDER, ALL OF OUR COVERAGE  AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AT  C-SPAN.ORG.  WE'LL CONTINUE TO WATCH THE  SCENE HERE AT THE U.S. CAPITOL   AND STACEY ABRAMS FOLLOWING  THAT OUR PHONE LINES ARE OPEN. WE'LL GET TO YOUR CALLS AND  COMMENTS ON THE PRESIDENT'S  SPEECH AND THE DEMOCRATIC  RESPONSE AS OUR COVERAGE   CONTINUES ON THE C-SPAN  NETWORKS. MS. ABRAMS: GOOD EVENING MY  FELLOW AMERICANS AND HAPPY   LUNAR NEW YEAR.  I'M STACEY ABRAMS AND I'M  HONORED TO JOIN THE  CONVERSATION ABOUT THE STATE OF  OUR UNION. GROWING UP, MY FAMILY WENT BACK  AND FORTH BETWEEN LOWER MIDDLE   CLASS AND WORKING CLASS. YET, EVEN WHEN THEY CAME HOME  WEARY AND BONE-TIRED, MY   PARENTS FOUND A WAY TO SHOW US   ALL WHO WE COULD BE. MY LIBRARIAN MOTHER TAUGHT US  TO LOVE LEARNING.  MY FATHER, A SHIP YARD WORKER,   PUT IN OVERTIME AND EXTRA  SHIFTS, AND THEY MADE SURE WE  VOLUNTEERED TO HELP OTHERS.  LATER, THEY BOTH BECAME UNITED   METHODIST MINISTERS, AN  EXPRESSION OF THE FAITH THAT   GUIDES US. THESE WERE OUR FAMILY VALUES --  FAITH, SERVICE, EDUCATION, AND   RESPONSIBILITY.  NOW, WE ONLY HAD ONE CAR SO  SOMETIMES MY DAD TO HAD  HITCHHIKE AND WALK LONG  STRETCHES DURING THE 30-MILE   TRIP HOME FROM THE SHIPYARDS.  ONE RAINY NIGHT MY MOM GOT   WORRIED. WE PILED IN THE CAR AND WENT   LOOKING FOR HIM AND WE FOUND MY  DAD MAKING HIS WAY ALONG THE   ROAD SOAKED AND SHIVERING IN   HIS SHIRT SLEEVES. WHEN HE GOT IN THE CAR MY MOM  ASKED IF HE LEFT HIS COAT AT   WORK.  HE EXPLAINED HE HAD GIVEN IT TO  A HOMELESS MAN HE MET ON THE   HIGHWAY. WE WE ASKED WHY HE HAD GIVEN   AWAY HIS ONLY JACKET, MY DAD   TURNED TO US AND SAID, I KNEW  WHEN I LEFT THAT MAN HE'D STILL  BE ALONE BUT I COULD GIVE HIM  MY COAT BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE  COMING FOR ME. OUR POWER AND STRENGTH AS  AMERICANS LIVES IN OUR HARD  WORK AND OUR BELIEFS AND MORE. MY FAMILY UNDERSTOOD FIRSTHAND   THAT WHILE SUCCESS IS NOT  GUARANTEED, WE LIVE IN A NATION  WHERE OPPORTUNITY IS POSSIBLE. BUT WE DO NOT SUCCEED ALONE. IN THESE UNITED STATES, WHEN   TIMES ARE TOUGH, WE CAN  PERSEVERE BECAUSE OUR FRIENDS  AND NEIGHBORS WILL COME FOR US.  OUR FIRST RESPONDERS WILL COME   FOR US.  IT IS THIS MANTRA, THIS  UNCOMMON GRACE OF COMMUNITY  THAT HAS DRIVEN ME TO BECOME AN  ATTORNEY, A SMALL BUSINESS   OWNER, A WRITER, AND MOST  RECENTLY, THE DEMOCRATIC   NOMINEE FOR GOVERNOR OF  GEORGIA. MY REASON FOR RUNNING WAS  SIMPLE -- I LOVE OUR COUNTRY   AND ITS PROMISE OF OPPORTUNITY   FOR ALL. AND I STAND HERE TONIGHT   BECAUSE I HOLD FAST TO MY  FATHER'S CREDO, TOGETHER WE ARE  COMING FOR AMERICA, FOR A  BETTER AMERICA.  JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, I JOINED   VOLUNTEERS TO DISTRIBUTE MEALS   TO FURLOUGHED FEDERAL WORKERS. THEY WAITED IN LINE FOR A BOX  OF FOOD, AND THE SLIVER OF HOPE  SINCE THEY HADN'T RECEIVED   PAYCHECKS IN WEEKS.  MAKING LIVELIHOODS OF OUR  FEDERAL WORKERS A PAWN FOR   POLITICAL GAMES IS A DISGRACE. THE SHUTDOWN WAS A STUNT,  ENGINEERED BY THE PRESIDENT OF   THE UNITED STATES, ONE THAT  DEFIED EVERY TENET OF FAIRNESS   AND ABANDONED NOT JUST OUR   PEOPLE BUT OUR VALUES. FOR SEVEN YEARS, I LED THE   DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE GEORGIA  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.  I DIDN'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH THE   REPUBLICAN SPEAKER OR GOVERNOR,  BUT I UNDERSTOOD THAT OUR  CONSTITUENTS DIDN'T CARE ABOUT   OUR POLITICAL PARTIES. THEY CARED ABOUT THEIR LIVES.  SO WHEN WE HAD TO NEGOTIATE  CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM OR   TRANSPORTATION OR FOST HE CARE   IMPROVEMENTS, THE -- FOSTER  CARE IMPROVEMENTS, THE LEADERS   OF OUR STATE DIDN'T SHUT DOWN. WE CAME TOGETHER AND WE KEPT   OUR WORD.  IT SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT IN   OUR NATION'S CAPITOL.  WE MAY COME FROM DIFFERENT   SIDES OF THE POLITICAL AISLE,  BUT OUR JOINT COMMITMENT TO THE  IDEALS OF THIS NATION CANNOT BE  NEGOTIABLE.  OUR MOST URGENT WORK IS TO   REALIZE AMERICANS' DREAMS OF   TODAY AND TOMORROW, TO CARVE A   PATH TO INDEPENDENCE AND   PROSPERITY THAT CAN LAST A   LIFETIME.  CHILDREN DESERVE AN EXCELLENT  EDUCATION FROM CRADLE TO   CAREER.  WE OWE THEM SAFE SCHOOLS AND   THE HIGHEST STANDARDS,   REGARDLESS OF ZIP CODE.  YET, THIS WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS   TIMIDLY WHILE FIRST GRADERS  PRACTICE ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS   AND THE PRICE OF HIGHER  EDUCATION GROWS EVER STEEPER.  FROM NOW ON, OUR LEADERS MUST  BE WILLING TO TACKLE GUN SAFETY  MEASURES AND FACE THE CRIPPLING  EFFECT OF EDUCATIONAL LOANS, TO  SUPPORT EDUCATORS AND INVEST   WHAT IS NECESSARY TO UNLEASH   THE POWER OF AMERICA'S GREATEST  MINDS. IN GEORGIA AND AROUND THE  COUNTRY, PEOPLE ARE STRIVING   FOR A MIDDLE CLASS WHERE A   SALARY TRULY EQUALS ECONOMIC   SECURITY.  BUT INSTEAD, FAMILIES' HOPES   ARE BEING CRUSHED BY REPUBLICAN  LEADERSHIP THAT IGNORES REAL   LIFE OR JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND  IT.  UNDER THE CURRENT  ADMINISTRATION, FAR TOO MANY   HARDWORKING AMERICANS ARE FALL   BEHIND, LIVING PAYCHECK TO   PAYCHECK, MOST WITHOUT LABOR   UNIONS TO PROTECT THEM FROM  EVEN WORSE HARM. THE REPUBLICAN TAX BILL RIGGED   THE SYSTEM AGAINST WORKING   PEOPLE.  RATHER THAN BRINGING BACK JOBS,  PLANTS ARE CLOSING, LAYOFFS ARE  LOOMING, AND WAGES STRUGGLE TO   KEEP PACE WITH THE ACTUAL COST   OF LIVING. WE OWE MORE TO THE MILLIONS OF   EVERYDAY FOLKS WHO KEEP OUR  ECONOMY RUNNING, LIKE TRUCK  DRIVERS FORCED TO BUY THEIR OWN  RIGS, FARMERS CAUGHT IN A TRADE  WAR, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN  SEARCH OF CAPITAL, AND DOMESTIC  WORKERS SERVING WITHOUT LABOR  PROTECTIONS. WOMEN AND MEN WHO COULD THRIVE   IF ONLY THEY HAD THE SUPPORT   AND FREEDOM TO DO SO.  WE KNOW BIPARTISANSHIP COULD   CRAFT A 21ST CENTURY   IMMIGRATION PLAN, BUT THIS   ADMINISTRATION CHOOSES TO CAGE   CHILDREN AND TEAR FAMILIES   APART. COMPASSIONATE TREATMENT AT THE   BORDER IS NOT THE SAME AS OPEN   BORDERS. PRESIDENT REAGAN UNDERSTOOD  THIS.  PRESIDENT OBAMA UNDERSTOOD   THIS.  AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THIS. AND DEMOCRATS STAND READY TO   EFFECTIVELY SECURE OUR PORTS   AND BORDERS, BUT WE MUST ALLEM   BRACE THAT FROM AGRICULTURE TO   HEALTH CARE -- ALL  EMBRACE  THAT FROM AGRICULTURE TO HEALTH  CARE, AMERICA IS STRONGER WITH   IMMIGRANTS, NOT WALLS. RATHER THAN SUING TO DISMANTLE   THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AS  REPUBLICANS' ATTORNEYS GENERALS  HAVE, OUR LEADERS MUST PROTECT   THE PROGRESS WE MADE AND COMMIT  TO EXPANDING HEALTH CARE AND   LOWERING COST FOR EVERYONE.  MY FATHER HAS BATTLED PROSTATE   CANCER FOR YEARS.  TO HELP COVER THE COST, I FOUND  MYSELF SINKING DEEPER INTO DEBT  BECAUSE WHILE YOU CAN DEFER  SOME PAYMENTS, YOU CAN'T DEFER   CANCER TREATMENT.  IN THIS GREAT NATION, AMERICANS  ARE SKIPPING BLOOD PRESSURE  PILLS, FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN  BUYING MEDICINE OR PAYING RENT.  MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES SHOW  THAT MOTHERS, ESPECIALLY BLACK   MOTHERS, RISK DEATH TO GIVE  BIRTH. AND IN 14 STATES, INCLUDING MY   HOME STATE, WHERE A MAJORITY   WANT IT, OUR LEADERS REFUSE TO   EXPAND MEDICAID WHICH COULD  SAVE RURAL HOSPITALS, SAVE   ECONOMIES AND SAVE LIVES.  WE CAN DO SO MUCH MORE, TAKE   ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE,  DEFEND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES  WITH FAIR-MINDED JUDGES. BUT NONE OF THESE AMBITIONS ARE  POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE BEDROCK   GUARANTEE OF OUR RIGHT TO VOTE.  LET'S BE CLEAR.  VOTER SUPPRESSION IS REAL. FROM MAKING IT HARDER TO   REGISTER AND STAY ON THE ROLLS   TO MOVING AND CLOSING POLLING  PLACES, TO REJECTING LAWFUL  BALLOTS, WE CAN NO LONGER  IGNORE THESE THREATS TO  DEMOCRACY. WHILE I ACKNOWLEDGE THE RESULTS  OF THE 2018 ELECTION HERE IN   GEORGIA, I DID NOT AND WE  CANNOT ACCEPT EFFORTS TO   UNDERMINE OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. THAT'S WHY I STARTED A   NONPARTISAN ORGANIZATION CALLED  FAIR FIGHT, TO ADVOCATE FOR  VOTING RIGHTS. THIS IS THE NEXT BATTLE FOR OUR  DEMOCRACY, ONE WHERE ALL   ELIGIBLE CITIZENS CAN HAVE A   SAY THE VISION THEY WANT FOR   OUR COUNTRY. WE MUST REJECT THE CYNICISM  THAT SAYS EVERY CAST TO BE   COUNT AND COUNTED IS A POWER   GRAB.  AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THAT THESE  ARE THE VALUES OUR BRAVE MEN   AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND OUR   VETERANS RISK THEIR LIVES TO   DEFEND.  THE FOUNDATION OF OUR MORAL  LEADERSHIP AROUND THE GLOBE IS   FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS, WHERE   VOTERS PICK THEIR LEADERS, NOT   WHERE POLITICIANS PICK THEIR   VOTERS.  IN THIS TIME OF DIVISION AND   CRISIS, WE MUST COME TOGETHER  AND STAND FOR AND WITH ONE   ANOTHER. AMERICA HAS STUMBLED TIME AND  AGAIN ON ITS QUEST TOWARDS   JUSTICE AND EQUALITY, BUT WITH   EACH GENERATION, WE HAVE   REVISITED OUR FUNDAMENTAL  TRUTHS AND WHERE WE FALTER, WE   MAKE AMENDS. WE FOUGHT JIM CROW WITH THE  CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND THE VOTING  RIGHTS ACT.  YET, WE CONTINUE TO CONFRONT   RACISM FROM OUR PAST AND IN OUR  PRESENT, WHICH IS WHY WE MUST  HOLD EVERYONE FROM THE HIGHEST   OFFICES TO OUR OWN FAMILIES  ACCOUNTABLE FOR RACIST WORDS   AND DEEDS AND CALL RACISM WHAT   IT IS -- WRONG.  AMERICA ACHIEVES A MEASURE OF  REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IN ROE V.   WADE, BUT WE MUST NEVER FORGET,  IT IS IMMORAL TO ALLOW   POLITICIANS TO HARM WOMEN AND  FAMILIES TO ADVANCE A POLITICAL  AGENDA.  WE AFFIRMED MAINLY EQUALITY,   AND YET THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY  REMAINS UNDER ATTACK.  SO EVEN AS I AM VERY   DISAPPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT'S  APPROACH TO OUR PROBLEMS, I  STILL DON'T WANT HIM TO FAIL.  BUT WE NEED HIM TO TELL THE  TRUTH AND TO RESPECT HIS DUTIES  AND RESPECT THE EXTRAORDINARY  DIVERSITY WANT HIM THAT DEFINES  OUR PROGRESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN   FOUND IN THE REFUGE, IN THE  BASIC INSTINCT OF THE AMERICAN   EXPERIMENT -- TO DO RIGHT BY   OUR PEOPLE.  AND WITH A RENEWED COMMITMENT  TO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE,  WE WILL CREATE A STRONGER  AMERICA TOGETHER.  BECAUSE AMERICA WINS BY  FIGHTING FOR OUR SHARED VALUES   AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN   AND DOMESTIC.  THAT IS WHO WE ARE, AND WHEN WE  DO SO, NEVER WAVERING, THE   STATE OF OUR UNION WILL ALWAYS   BE STRONG. THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS]
