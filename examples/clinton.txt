WHO WANTS A GOOD JOB CAN GET ONE AND WELL BUILD A PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP FOR MILLIONS OF  IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE ALREADY  CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMY WE WILL NOT BAN A RELIGION WE WILL WORK WITH ALL AMERICANS  AND OUR ALLIES TO FIGHT AND  DEFEAT TERRORISM YET WE KNOW THERE IS A LOT TO  DO TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVENT HAD A  PAY RAISE SINCE THE CRASH THERES TOO MUCH INEQUALITY TOO LITTLE SOCIAL MOBILITY TOO MUCH PARALYSIS IN WASHINGTON TOO  MANY THREATS AT HOME AND ABROAD BUT JUST LOOK FOR A MINUTE AT  THE STRENGTHS WE BRING AS  AMERICANS TO MEET THESE  CHALLENGES WE HAVE THE MOST DYNAMIC AND  DIVERSE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WE HAVE THE MOST TOLERANT AND  GENEROUS YOUNG PEOPLE WEVE EVER HAD WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL  MILITARY THE MOST INNOVATIVE  ENTREPRENEURS THE MOST ENDURING VALUES FREEDOM

WHEN PEOPLE HEAR THOSE WORDS  THEY HEAR AMERICA SO DONT LET ANYONE TELL YOU  THAT OUR COUNTRY IS WEAK WERE NOT DONT LET ANYONE TELL YOU WE  DONT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES WE DO AND MOST OF ALL DONT BELIEVE  ANYONE WHO SAYS I ALONE CAN FIX  IT YES THOSE WERE ACTUALLY DONALD  TRUMPS WORDS IN CLEVELAND AND THEY SHOULD SET OFF ALARM  BELLS FOR ALL OF US REALLY I ALONE CAN FIX IT ISNT HE FORGETTING TROOPS ON  THE FRONT LINES POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS WHO RUN TOWARD  DANGER DOCTORS AND NURSES WHO  CARE FOR US TEACHERS WHO CHANGE LIVES ENTREPRENEURS WHO SEE  POSSIBILITIES IN EVERY PROBLEM  MOTHERS WHO

REMEMBER OUR  FOUNDERS FOUGHT A REVOLUTION AND WROTE A CONSTITUTION SO AMERICA  WOULD NEVER BE A NATION WHERE  ONE PERSON HAD ALL OF THE POWER 240 YEARS LATER WE STILL PUT OUR FAITH IN EACH OTHER LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN DALLAS  AFTER THE ASSASSINATIONS OF FIVE BRAVE POLICE OFFICERS POLICE CHIEF DAVID BROWN ASKED  THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT HIS  FORCE MAYBE EVEN JOIN THEM AND YOU KNOW HOW THE COMMUNITY  RESPONDED NEARLY 500 PEOPLE APPLIED IN  JUST 12 DAYS THATS HOW AMERICANS ANSWER WHEN THE CALL FOR HELP GOES OUT TWENTY YEARS AGO I WROTE A BOOK  CALLED IT TAKES A VILLAGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKED AT  THE TITLE AND ASKED WHAT THE  HECK DO YOU MEAN BY THAT THIS IS WHAT I MEAN NONE OF US CAN RAISE A FAMILY  BUILD A BUSINESS HEAL A  COMMUNITY OR LIFT A COUNTRY  TOTALLY ALONE AMERICA NEEDS EVERY ONE OF US TO LEND OUR ENERGY OUR TALENTS  OUR AMBITION TO MAKING OUR  NATION BETTER AND STRONGER I BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL OF MY  HEART THATS WHY STRONGER TOGETHER IS  NOT JUST A LESSON FROM OUR  HISTORY ITS NOT JUST A SLOGAN  FOR OUR CAMPAIGN ITS A GUIDING PRINCIPLE FOR THE COUNTRY WEVE ALWAYS BEEN AND  THE FUTURE WERE GOING TO BUILD A COUNTRY WHERE THE ECONOMY  WORKS FOR EVERYONE NOT JUST  THOSE AT THE TOP WHERE YOU CAN GET A GOOD JOB AND SEND YOUR KIDS TO A GOOD SCHOOL  NO MATTER WHAT ZIP CODE YOU LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE ALL OUR CHILDREN CAN DREAM AND THOSE DREAMS ARE  WITHIN REACH WHERE FAMILIES ARE STRONG  COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE AND YES  WHERE LOVE TRUMPS HATE THAT  THATS THE COUNTRY WERE FIGHTING FOR THATS THE FUTURE WERE WORKING  TOWARD AND SO MY FRIENDS IT IS WITH  HUMILITY DETERMINATION AND  BOUNDLESS CONFIDENCE IN  AMERICAS PROMISE THAT I ACCEPT  YOUR NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  CHEERS  APPLAUSE   CHEERS  APPLAUSE  NOW SOMETIMES SOMETIMES THE  PEOPLE AT THIS PODIUM ARE NEW TO THE NATIONAL STAGE AS YOU KNOW IM NOT ONE OF  THOSE PEOPLE IVE BEEN YOUR FIRST LADY  SERVED EIGHT YEARS AS A SENATOR  FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NEW  YORK THEN I REPRESENTED ALL OF  YOU AS SECRETARY OF STATE BUT MY JOB TITLES ONLY TELL YOU  WHAT IVE DONE THEY DONT TELL YOU WHY THE TRUTH IS THROUGH ALL OF  THESE YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE  THE SERVICE PART HAS ALWAYS COME EASIER TO ME THAN THE PUBLIC  PART I GET IT THAT SOME PEOPLE JUST  DONT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF ME SO LET ME TELL YOU THE FAMILY  IM FROM WELL NO ONE HAD THEIR  NAME ON BIG BUILDINGS MY FAMILY WERE BUILDERS OF A  DIFFERENT KIND BUILDERS IN THE  WAY MOST AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE THEY USED WHATEVER TOOLS THEY  HAD WHATEVER GOD GAVE THEM AND  WHATEVER LIFE IN AMERICA  PROVIDED AND BUILT BETTER LIVES  AND BETTER FUTURES FOR THEIR  KIDS MY GRANDFATHER WORKED IN THE  SAME SCRANTON LACE MILL FOR 50  YEARS BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THAT IF HE  GAVE EVERYTHING HE HAD HIS  CHILDREN WOULD HAVE A BETTER  LIFE THAN HE DID AND HE WAS RIGHT MY DAD MADE IT TO COLLEGE HE  PLAYED FOOTBALL AT PENN STATE  AND ENLISTED IN THE NAVY AFTER  PEARL HARBOR WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER HE STARTED HIS OWN SMALL BUSINESS PRINTING  FABRIC FOR DRAPERIES I REMEMBER WATCHING HIM STAND  FOR HOURS OVER SILK SCREENS HE WANTED TO GIVE ME BROTHERS  AND ME OPPORTUNITIES HE NEVER  HAD AND HE DID MY MOTHER DOROTHY WAS ABANDONED  BY HER PARENTS AS A YOUNG GIRL SHE ENDED UP ON HER OWN AT 14  WORKING AS A HOUSE MAID SHE WAS SAVED BY THE KINDNESS OF OTHERS HER FIRST GRADE TEACHER SAW SHE  HAD NOTHING TO EAT AT LUNCH AND  BROUGHT EXTRA FOOD TO SHARE THE  ENTIRE YEAR THE LESSON SHE PASSED ON TO ME  YEARS LATER STUCK WITH ME NO ONE GETS THROUGH LIFE ALONE WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH  OTHER AND LIFT EACH OTHER UP AND SHE MADE SURE I LEARNED THE  WORDS FROM OUR METHODIST FAITH  DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN FOR ALL  THE PEOPLE YOU CAN AND ALL OF  THE WAYS YOU CAN AS LONG AS EVER YOU CAN SO I WENT TO WORK FOR THE  CHILDRENS DEFENSE FUND GOING  DOOR TO DOOR IN NEW BEDFORD  MASSACHUSETTS ON BEHALF OF  CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WHO  WERE DENIED THE CHANCE TO GO TO  SCHOOL I REMEMBER MEETING A YOUNG GIRL  IN A WHEELCHAIR ON THE SMALL  BACK PORCH OF HER HOUSE SHE TOLD ME HOW BADLY SHE WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL IT JUST DIDNT SEEM POSSIBLE IN  THOSE DAYS AND I COULDNT STOP THINKING OF  MY MOTHER AND WHAT SHE HAD GONE  THROUGH AS A CHILD IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT  SIMPLY CARING IS NOT ENOUGH TO DRIVE REAL PROGRESS YOU HAVE  TO CHANGE BOTH HEARTS AND LAWS YOU NEED BOTH UNDERSTANDING AND  ACTION SO WE GATHERED FACTS WE BUILT A COALITION AND OUR WORK HELPED  CONVINCE CONGRESS TO ENSURE  ACCESS TO EDUCATION FOR ALL  STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ITS A BIG IDEA ISNT IT EVERY KID WITH A DISABILITY HAS  THE RIGHT TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT HOW HOW DO YOU MAKE AN IDEA LIKE  THAT REAL YOU DO IT STEP BY STEP YEAR BY YEAR SOMETIMES EVEN  DOOR BY DOOR MY HEART JUST SWELLED WHEN I SAW ANASTASIA REPRESENTING MILLIONS  OF YOUNG PEOPLE ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE WE CHANGED OUR LAW TO  MAKE SURE SHE GOT AN EDUCATION SO ITS TRUE I SWEAT THE  DETAILS OF POLICY WHETHER WERE  TALKING ABOUT THE EXACT LEVEL OF LEAD IN THE DRINKING WATER IN  FLINT MICHIGAN THE NUMBER OF  MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES IN IOWA OR THE COST OF YOUR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BECAUSE ITS NOT JUST A DETAIL  IF ITS YOUR KID IF ITS YOUR  FAMILY ITS A BIG DEAL AND IT SHOULD BE A BIG DEAL TO  YOUR PRESIDENT TOO AFTER THE FOUR DAYS OF THIS  CONVENTION YOUVE SEEN SOME OF  THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSPIRED ME PEOPLE WHO LET ME INTO THEIR  LIVES AND BECAME A PART OF MINE PEOPLE LIKE RYAN MOORE AND  LAUREN MANNING THEY TOLD THEIR STORIES TUESDAY  NIGHT I FIRST MET RYAN AS A  7YEAROLD HE WAS WEARING A FULL BODY BRACE THAT MUST HAVE WEIGHED 40 POUNDS BECAUSE I LEANED OVER TO LIFT  HIM UP CHILDREN LIKE RYAN KEPT ME GOING WHEN OUR PLAN FOR UNIVERSAL  HEALTH CARE FAILED AND KEPT ME  WORKING WITH LEADERS OF BOTH  PARTIES TO HELP CREATE THE  CHILDRENS HEALTH INSURANCE  PROGRAM THAT COVERS 8 MILLION  KIDS IN OUR COUNTRY LAUREN MANNING WHO STOOD HERE  WITH SUCH GRACE AND POWER WAS  GRAVELY INJURED ON 911 IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF HER AND  DEBBIE ST JOHN WHO YOU SAW IN  THE MOVIE AND JOHN DOLAND AND  JOHN SWEENEY AND ALL OF THE  VICTIM AND SURVIVORS THAT KEPT  ME WORKING AS HARD AS I COULD IN THE SENATE ON BEHALF OF 911  FAMILIES AND OUR FIRST  RESPONDERS WHO GOT SICK FROM  THEIR TIME AT GROUND ZERO I WAS THINKING OF LAUREN DEBBIE AND ALL OF THE OTHERS TEN YEARS  LATER IN THE WHITE HOUSE  SITUATION ROOM WHEN PRESIDENT  OBAMA MADE THE COURAGEOUS  DECISION THAT FINALLY BROUGHT  OSAMA BIN LADEN TO JUSTICE AND IN THIS CAMPAIGN IVE MET  MANY MORE PEOPLE WHO MOTIVATE ME TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR CHANGE AND WITH YOUR HELP I WILL CARRY  ALL OF YOUR VOICES AND STORIES  WITH ME TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOU HEARD YOU HEARD FROM  REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO ARE SUPPORTING OUR CAMPAIGN  WELL I WILL BE A PRESIDENT FOR  DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS  INDEPENDENTS FOR THE  STRUGGLING THE STRIVING THE  SUCCESSFUL FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO  VOTE FOR ME AND FOR THOSE WHO  DONT FOR ALL AMERICANS TOGETHER TONIGHT TONIGHT WEVE REACHED A MILESTONE IN OUR NATIONS MARCH  TOWARD A MORE PERFECT UNION THE FIRST TIME THAT A MAJOR  PARTY HAS DOMINATED A WOMAN FOR  PRESIDENT STANDING HERE AS MY MOTHERS  DAUGHTER AND MY DAUGHTERS  MOTHER IM SO HAPPY THIS DAY  HAS COME IM HAPPY FOR GRANDMOTHERS AND  LITTLE GIRLS AND EVERYONE IN  BETWEEN IM HAPPY FOR BOYS AND MEN  BECAUSE WHEN ANY BARRIER FALLS  IN AMERICA IT CLEARS THE WAY  FOR EVERYONE AFTER ALL WHEN THERE ARE NO  CEILINGS THE SKY IS THE LIMIT SO LETS KEEP GOING LETS KEEP GOING UNTIL EVERY ONE OF THE 161 MILLION WOMEN AND  GIRLS ACROSS AMERICA HAS THE  OPPORTUNITY SHE DESERVES TO  HAVE BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE HISTORY WE MAKE TONIGHT IS THE  HISTORY WELL WRITE TOGETHER IN  THE YEARS AHEAD LETS BEGIN WITH WHAT WERE  GOING TO DO TO HELP WORKING  PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY GET AHEAD  AND STAY AHEAD NOW I DONT THINK PRESIDENT  OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN  GET THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE FOR  SAVING US FROM THE WORST  ECONOMIC CRISIS OF OUR  LIFETIMES OUR ECONOMY IS SO MUCH STRONGER  THAN WHEN THEY TOOK OFFICE NEARLY 15 MILLION NEW PRIVATE  SECTOR JOBS 20 MILLION MORE  AMERICANS WITH HEALTH INSURANCE  AND AN AUTO INDUSTRY THAT JUST  HAD ITS BEST YEAR EVER NOW THATS REAL PROGRESS BUT  NONE OF US CAN BE SATISFIED WITH THE STATUS QUO NOT BY A LONG  SHOT WERE STILL FACING DEEP SEEDED  PROBLEMS THAT DEVELOPING LONG  BEFORE THE RECESSION AND HAVE  STAYED WITH US IVE GONE AROUND THE COUNTRY  TALKING TO WORKING FAMILIES AND  I HAVE HEARD FROM MANY WHO FEEL  THAT THE ECONOMY SURE ISNT  WORKING FOR THEM SOME OF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED EVEN FURIOUS AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE RIGHT ITS NOT YET WORKING THE WAY IT  SHOULD AMERICANS ARE WILLING TO WORK  AND WORK HARD BUT RIGHT NOW AN  AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THERE  IS LESS AND LESS RESPECT FOR THE WORK THEY DO AND LESS RESPECT FOR THEM  PERIOD DEMOCRATS WE ARE THE PARTY OF  WORKING PEOPLE BUT WE HAVENT DONE A GOOD  ENOUGH JOB SHOWING WE GET WHAT  YOURE DOING THROUGH AND WERE  GOING TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP TONIGHT I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW  WE WILL EMPOWER AMERICANS TO  LIVE BETTER LIVES MY PRIMARY MISSION AS PRESIDENT  WILL BE TO CREATE MORE  OPPORTUNITY AND MORE GOOD JOBS  WITH RISING WAGES RIGHT HERE IN  THE UNITED STATES FROM MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE TO  MY LAST ESPECIALLY IN PLACES  THAT FOR TOO LONG HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND FROM OUR  INNER CITIES TO OUR SMALL TOWNS FROM INDIAN COUNTRY TO COAL  COUNTRY FROM COMMUNITIES  RAVAGED BY ADDICTION TO REGIONS HOLLOWED OUT BY PLANT CLOSURES AND HERES WHAT I BELIEVE I BELIEVE AMERICA THRIVES WHEN  THE MIDDLE CLASS THRIVES I BELIEVE OUR ECONOMY ISNT  WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD  BECAUSE OUR DEMOCRACY ISNT  WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD THATS WHY WE NEED TO APPOINT  SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WHO WILL  GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS AND  EXPAND VOTING RIGHTS NOT  RESTRICT THEM AND IF NECESSARY WE WILL PASS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO  OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED I BELIEVE AMERICAN CORPORATIONS  THAT HAVE GOTTEN SO MUCH FROM  OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE JUST AS  PATRIOTIC IN RETURN MANY OF THEM ARE BUT TOO MANY  ARENT ITS WRONG TO TAKE TAX BREAKS  WITH ONE HAND AND GIVE OUT PINK  SLIPS WITH THE OTHER AND I BELIEVE WALL STREET CAN  NEVER EVER BE ALLOWED TO WRECK  MAIN STREET AGAIN AND I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE I BELIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND THAT WE CAN SAVE OR PLANET  WHILE CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD  PAYING CLEAN ENERGY JOBS I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE HAVE  MILLIONS OF HARDWORKING  IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTING TO OUR  ECONOMY IT WOULD BE SELF  DEFEATING AND INHUMAN TO TRY TO  KICK THEM OUT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WILL GROW OUR ECONOMY AND KEEP  FAMILIES TOGETHER AND ITS THE  RIGHT THING TO DO SO WHATEVER PARTY YOU BELONG TO  OR IF YOU BELONG TO NO PARTY AT  ALL IF YOU SHARE THESE BELIEFS THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT COMPANIES  SHOULD SHARE PROFITS NOT PAD  EXECUTIVE BONUSES JOIN US IF YOU BELIEVE THE MINIMUM WAGE  SHOULD BE A LIVING WAGE AND NO  ONE WORKING FULL TIME SHOULD  HAVE TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN IN  POVERTY JOIN US IF YOU BELIEVE THAT EVERY MAN  WOMAN AND CHILD IN AMERICA HAS  THE RIGHT TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH  CARE JOIN US IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD  SAY NO TO UNFAIR TRADE DEALS  THAT WE SHOULD STAND UP TO  CHINA THAT WE SHOULD SUPPORT  OUR STEELWORKERS AND AUTO  WORKERS AND HOME GROWN  MANUFACTURERS THEN JOIN US IF YOU BELIEVE WE SHOULD EXPAND  SOCIAL SECURITY AND PROTECT A  WOMANS RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN  HEALTH CARE DECISIONS THEN JOIN US AND YES YES IF YOU BELIEVE  THAT YOUR WORKING MOTHER WIFE  SISTER OR DAUGHTER DESERVES  EQUAL PAY JOIN US THATS HOW WERE GOING TO MAKE  SURE THIS ECONOMY WORKS FOR  EVERYONE NOT JUST THOSE AT THE  TOP NOW YOU DIDNT HEAR ANY OF  THIS DID YOU FROM DONALD TRUMP AT HIS CONVENTION HE SPOKE FOR 70 ODD MINUTES AND I DO MEAN ODD AND HE OFFERED  ZERO SOLUTIONS BUT WE ALREADY KNOW HE DOESNT  BELIEVE THESE THINGS NO WONDER HE DOESNT LIKE  TALKING ABOUT HIS PLANS YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED I LOVE  TALKING ABOUT MINE IN MY FIRST 100 DAYS WE WILL  WORK WITH BOTH PARTIES TO PASS  THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN NEW  GOODPAYING JOBS SINCE WORLD WAR II JOBS IN MANUFACTURING CLEAN  ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AND  INNOVATION SMALL BUSINESS AND  INFRASTRUCTURE IF WE INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE  NOW WELL NOT ONLY CREATE JOBS  TODAY BUT LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE AND WE WILL ALSO TRANSFORM THE  WAY WE PREPARE OR YOUNG PEOPLE  FOR THOSE JOBS BERNIE SANDERS AND I WILL WORK  TOGETHER TO MAKE COLLEGE TUITION FREE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND  DEBT FREE FOR ALL WE WILL ALSO  WE WILL ALSO  LIBERATE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO  ALREADY HAVE STUDENT DEBT ITS JUST NOT RIGHT THAT DONALD  TRUMP CAN IGNORE HIS DEBTS AND  STUDENTS AND FAMILIES CANT  REFINANCE THEIR DEBTS AND SOMETHING WE DONT SAY OFTEN ENOUGH SURE COLLEGE IS  CRUCIAL BUT A FOURYEAR DEGREE  SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY PATH TO A GOOD JOB WE WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE LEARN A SKILL OR PRACTICE A TRADE AND  MAKE A GOOD LIVING DOING IT WE WILL GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES  LIKE MY DADS A BOOST MAKE IT  EASIER TO GET CREDIT WAY TOO MANY DREAMS DIE IN THE  PARKING LOTS OF BANKS IN AMERICA IF YOU CAN DREAM IT  YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD IT AND WE WILL HELP YOU BALANCE  FAMILY AND WORK AND YOU KNOW WHAT IF FIGHTING FOR AFFORDABLE  CHILDCARE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE  IS PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD THEN  DEAL ME IN NOW  NOW HERES THE OTHER  THING NOW WERE NOT ONLY WERE NOT  ONLY GOING TO MAKE ALL OF THESE  INVESTMENTS WERE GOING TO PAY  FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM AND HERES HOW WALL STREET CORPORATIONS AND  THE SUPER RICH ARE GOING TO  START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES THIS IS THIS IS NOT BECAUSE WE  RESENT SUCCESS BUT WHEN MORE THAN 90 OF THE  GAINS HAVE GONE TO THE TOP 1  THATS WHERE THE MONEY IS AND WE ARE GOING TO FOLLOW THE  MONEY AND IF COMPANIES TAKE TAX BREAKS AND THEN SHIFT JOBS OVERSEAS  WELL MAKE THEM PAY US BACK AND  WELL PUT THAT MONEY TO WORK  WHERE IT BELONGS CREATING JOBS  HERE AT HOME NOW NOW I IMAGINE THAT SOME OF  YOU ARE SITTING AT HOME  THINKING WELL THAT ALL SOUNDS  PRETTY GOOD BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET IT  DONE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BREAK  THROUGH THE GRIDLOCK IN  WASHINGTON WELL LOOK AT MY RECORD I HAVE WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE  TO PASS LAWS AND TREATIES AND TO LAUNCH NEW PROGRAMS THAT  HELP MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHANCE  THATS EXACTLY WHAT ILL DO AS  PRESIDENT BUT THEN I ALSO IMAGINE PEOPLE  ARE THINKING OUT THERE BUT  TRUMP HES A BUSINESSMAN HE MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE ECONOMY WELL LETS TAKE A CLOSER LOOK  SHALL WE IN ATLANTIC CITY 60 MILES FROM  HERE YOU WILL FIND CONTRACTORS  AND SMALL BUSINESSES WHO LOST  EVERYTHING BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP  REFUSED TO PAY HIS BILLS NOW REMEMBER WHAT THE PRESIDENT  SAID LAST NIGHT DONT BOO VOTE BUT THINK OF THIS PEOPLE WHO DID THE WORK AND  NEEDED THE MONEY NOT BECAUSE HE COULDNT PAY THEM BUT BECAUSE HE WOULDNT PAY THEM HE JUST STIFFED THEM AND YOU KNOW THAT SALES PITCH  HES MAKING TO BE PRESIDENT PUT YOUR FAITH IN HIM AND YOULL WIN BIG THATS THE SAME SALES PITCH HE MADE TO ALL OF THOSE SMALL  BUSINESSES THEN TRUMP WALKED AWAY AND LEFT  WORKING PEOPLE HOLDING THE BAG HE ALSO TALKS A BIG GAME ABOUT  PUTTING AMERICA FIRST WELL PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT PART OF AMERICA FIRST LEADS HIM TO MAKE  TRUMP TIES IN CHINA NOT  COLORADO TRUMP SUITS IN MEXICO NOT MICHIGAN TRUMP FURNITURE IN TURKEY NOT OHIO TRUMP PICTURE  FRAMES IN INDIA NOT WISCONSIN DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN WELL HE COULD START BY ACTUALLY  MAKING THINGS IN AMERICA AGAIN NOW THE CHOICE WE FACE IN THIS  ELECTION IS JUST AS STARK WHEN  IT COMES TO OUR NATIONAL  SECURITY  CROWD CHANTING HILLARY  ANYONE READING THE NEWS CAN SEE  THE THREATS AND TUR BUT LANCE WE PHASE FROM BAGHDAD TO KABL FROM NICE TO BRUSSELS FROM SAN  BERNARDINO TO ORLANDO WERE  DEALING WITH DETERMINED ENEMIES  THAT MUST BE DEFEATED SO ITS NO WONDER THAT PEOPLE  ARE ANXIOUS AND LOOKING FOR  REASSURANCE LOOKING FOR STEADY  LEADERSHIP LOOKING FOR A LEADER WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT WERE  STRONGER WHEN WE WORK WITH OUR  ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD AND CARE FOR OUR VETERANS HERE AT HOME KEEPING OUR NATION SAFE AND  HONORING THE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT  WORK WILL BE MY HIGHEST  PRIORITY IM PROUD THAT WE PUT A LID ON  IRANS NUCLEAR PROGRAM WITHOUT  FIRING A SINGLE SHOT NOW WE HAVE TO ENFORCE IT AND WE MUST KEEP SUPPORTING ISRAELS  SECURITY IM PROUD THAT WE SHAPED A  GLOBAL CLIMATE AGREEMENT NOW WE HAVE TO HOLD EVERY  COUNTRY ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR  COMMITMENTS INCLUDING  OURSELVES AND IM PROUD TO STAND BY OUR  ALLIES IN NATO AGAINST ANY  THREAT THEY FACE INCLUDING FROM RUSSIA IVE LAID OUT MY STRATEGY FOR  DEFEATING ISIS WE WILL STRIKE THEIR SANCTUARIES FROM THE AIR AND SUPPORT LOCAL  FORCES TAKING THEM OUT ON THE  GROUND WE WILL SURGE OUR INTELLIGENCE  SO WE DETECT AND PREVENT ATTACKS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN WE WILL DISRUPT THEIR EFFORTS  ONLINE TO REACH AND RADICALIZE  YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY IT WONT BE EASY OR QUICK BUT  MAKE NO MISTAKE WE WILL  PREVAIL NOW DONALD TRUMP DONALD TRUMP  SAYS AND THIS IS A QUOTE I  KNOW MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN THE  GENERALS DO NO DONALD YOU DONT HE THINKS HE THINKS HE KNOWS  MORE THAN OUR MILITARY BECAUSE  HE CLAIMED OUR ARMED FORCES ARE  A DISASTER WELL I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR TROOPS AND OUR VETERANS FOR MANY YEARS  INCLUDING AS A SENATOR ON THE  ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE AND I  KNOW HOW WRONG HE IS OUR MILITARY IS A NATIONAL  TREASURE WE ENTRUST OUR COMMANDER IN  CHIEF TO MAKE THE HARDEST  DECISIONS OUR NATION FACES DECISIONS ABOUT WAR AND PEACE  LIFE AND DEATH A PRESIDENT SHOULD RESPECT THE  MEN AND WOMEN WHO RISK THEIR  LIVES TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY INCLUDING INCLUDING CAPTAIN  KANN AND THE SONS OF TIM KAINE  AND MIKE PENCE BOTH MARINES SO JUST ASK YOURSELF DO YOU  REALLY THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS  THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE COMMANDER  IN CHIEF DONALD TRUMP CANT EVEN HANDLE  THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE OF A  PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HE LOSES HIS COOL AT THE  SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION WHEN HES GOTTEN A TOUGH  QUESTION FROM A REPORTER WHEN  HES CHALLENGED IN A DEBATE WHEN HE SEE AS PROTESTER AT A  RALLY IMAGINE IF YOU DARE IMAGINE  IMAGINE HIM IN THE OVAL OFFICE  FACING A REAL CRISIS A MAN YOU CAN BAIT WITH A TWEET  IS NOT A MAN WE CAN TRUST WITH  NUCLEAR WEAPONS I CANT PUT IT I CANT PUT IT  ANY BETTER THAN JACKIE KENNEDY  DID AFTER THE CUBAN MISSILE  CRISIS SHE SAID THAT WHAT WORRIED  PRESIDENT KENNEDY DURING THAT  VERY DANGEROUS TIME WAS THAT A  WAR MIGHT BE STARTED NOT BY BIG MEN WITH SELF CONTROL AND  RESTRAINT BUT BY LITTLE MEN THE ONES MOVED BY FEAR AND PRIDE AMERICAS STRENGTH DOESNT COME  FROM LASHING OUT IT RELIES ON SMARTS JUDGMENT  COOL RESOLVE AND THE RESIES AND  STRATEGIC APPLICATION OF POWER  AND THATS THE KIND OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF I PLEDGE TO BE AND IF WERE SERIOUS ABOUT  KEEPING OUR COUNTRY SAFE WE  ALSO CANT AFFORD TO HAVE A  PRESIDENT WHOS IN THE POCKET OF THE GUN LOBBY IM NOT HERE TO REPEAL THE  SECOND AMENDMENT IM NOT HERE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR  GUNS I JUST DIDNT WANT YOU TO BE  SHOT BY SOMEONE WHO SHOULDNT  HAVE A GUN IN THE FIRST PLACE WE WILL WE WILL WORK TIRELESSLY WITH RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS TO  PASS COMMON SENSE REFORMS AND  KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF  CRIMINALS TERRORISTS AND ALL  OTHERS WHO WOULD DO US HARM YOU KNOW FOR DECADES PEOPLE  HAVE SAID THIS ISSUE WAS TOO  HARD TO SOLVE AND THE POLITICS  TOO HOT TO TOUCH BUT I ASK YOU HOW CAN WE JUST  STAND BY AND DO NOTHING YOU HEARD YOU SAW FAMILY  MEMBERS OF PEOPLE KILLED BY GUN  VIOLENCE ON THIS STAGE YOU HEARD YOU SAW FAMILY  MEMBERS OF POLICE OFFICERS  KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY  BECAUSE THEY WERE OUTGUNNED BY  CRIMINALS I REFUSE TO BELIEVE WE CANT  FIND COMMON GROUND HERE WE HAVE TO HEAL THE DIVIDES IN  OUR COUNTRY NOT JUST ON GUNS BUT ON RACE  IMMIGRATION AND MORE AND THAT STARTS WITH LISTENING  LISTENING TO EACH OTHER TRYING  AS BEST WE CAN TO WALK IN EACH  OTHERS SHOES SO LETS PUT OURSELVES IN THE  SHOES OF YOUNG BLACK AND LATINO  MEN AND WOMEN WHO FACE THE  EFFECTS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM AND  ARE MADE TO FEEL LIKE THEIR  LIVES ARE DISPOSABLE LETS PUT OURSELVES IN THE SHOES OF POLICE OFFICERS KISSING THEIR KIDS AND SPOUSES GOODBYE EVERY  DAY HEADING OFF TO DO A  DANGEROUS AND NECESSARY JOB WE WILL REFORM OUR CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SYSTEM FROM END TO END  AND REBUILD TRUST BETWEEN LAW  ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES  THEY SERVE AND WE WILL DEFEND WE WILL  DEFEND ALL OF OUR RIGHTS CIVIL  RIGHTS HUMAN RIGHTS AND VOTING  RIGHTS WOMENS RIGHTS AND  WORKERS RIGHTS LGBT RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH  DISABILITIES AND WE WILL STAND UP AGAINST  MEAN AND DIVISIVE RHETORIC  WHEREVER IT COMES FROM YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST YEAR MANY PEOPLE MADE THE MISTAKE OF  LAUGHING OFF DONALD TRUMPS  COMMENTS EXCUSING HIM AS AN  ENTERTAINER JUST PUTTING ON A  SHOW THEY THOUGHT HE COULDNT  POSSIBLY MEAN ALL OF THE  HORRIBLE THINGS HE SAYS LIKE WHEN HE CALLED WOMEN PIGS  OR SAID THAT AN AMERICAN JUDGE  COULDNT BE FAIR BECAUSE OF HIS  MEXICAN HERITAGE OR WHEN HE MOCKS AND MIMICS A  REPORTER WITH A DISABILITY OR  INSULTS PRISONERS OF WAR LIKE  JOHN McCAIN A HERO AND A  PATRIOT WHO DESERVES OUR  RESPECT NOW AT FIRST AT FIRST I ADMIT I COULDNT BELIEVE HE MEANT IT  EITHER IT WAS JUST TOO HARD TO FATHOM THAT SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO LEAD  OUR NATION COULD SAY THOSE  THINGS COULD BE LIKE THAT BUT HERES THE SAD TRUTH THERE IS NO OTHER DONALD TRUMP THIS IS IT AND IN THE END IT COMES DOWN TO  WHAT DONALD TRUMP DOESNT GET AMERICA IS GREAT BECAUSE AMERICA IS GOOD SO ENOUGH WITH THE BIGOTRY DONALD TRUMP ISNT OFFERING REAL CHANGE HES OFFERING EMPTY PROMISES AND WHAT ARE WE OFFERING A BOLD AGENDA TO IMPROVE THE  LIVES OF PEOPLE ACROSS OUR  COUNTRY TO KEEP YOU SAFE TO GET YOU GOOD

WORLD COUNTRIES WE HAVE A LOT OF URGENT AND  IMPORTANT WORK TO DO AND THATS WHAT IM GOING TO TALK ABOUT  TODAY BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE I HAVE  MET THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN  REALLY PROVE HOW WRONG THIS  NEGATIVE PESSIMISTIC VIEW IS AMERICAS BEST DAYS ARE STILL  AHEAD OF US IF WE MAKE UP OUR  MINDS TO ACTUALLY GO OUT AND  MAKE THAT HAPPEN JUST CONSIDER OUR ASSETS WE HAVE THE MOST DYNAMIC  PRODUCTIVE WORKFORCE IN THE  WORLD BAR NONE WE HAVE THE MOST INNOVATIVE  BUSINESSES THE TOP COLLEGES  UNIVERSITIES COMMUNITY  COLLEGES TRAINING PROGRAMS IN  THE WORLD AND THE BEST SCIENCE  AND TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE ENORMOUS CAPACITY FOR  CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTION WE ARE RESILIENT DETERMINED  HARD WORKING THERE IS NOTHING AMERICA CANT  DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE THIS IS  HOW I WAS RAISED AND I DONT  THINK MR TRUMP UNDERSTANDS ANY  OF IT HE HASNT OFFERED ANY CREDIBLE  SOLUTIONS FOR THE VERY REAL  ECONOMIC CHALLENGES WE FACE NOW THOSE CHALLENGES EMERGED  LONG BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION AND THEY HAVE PERSISTED THROUGH  OUR RECOVERY THERE IS TOO MUCH INEQUALITY  TOO LITTLE UPWARD MOBILITY IT IS JUST TOO HARD TO GET AHEAD TODAY BUT THERE ARE COMMON SENSE  THINGS THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT  COULD DO THAT WOULD GIVE  AMERICANS MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO  SUCCEED WHY DONT WE DO IT BECAUSE POWERFUL SPECIAL  INTERESTS AND THE TENDENCY TO  PUT IDEOLOGY AHEAD OF POLITICAL  PROGRESS HAVE LED TO GRIDLOCK IN CONGRESS HOW CAN YOU NOT BE FRUSTRATED  AND EVEN ANGRY WHEN YOU SEE  NOTHING GETTING DONE A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL NO ONE IS  ON THEIR SIDE AND NO ONE HAS  THEIR BACK AND THAT IS NOT HOW  ITS SUPPOSED TO BE IN AMERICA IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE  YOUR PRESIDENT I WILL HAVE YOUR BACK EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I  SERVE AND MY MISSION IN THE WHITE  HOUSE WILL BE TO MAKE OUR  ECONOMY WORK FOR EVERYONE NOT  JUST THOSE AT THE TOP THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME I AM THE PRODUCT OF THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO I WAS RAISED IN A SUBURB BUT MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THE SCRANTON LACE MILL IN SCRANTON  PENNSYLVANIA FOR 50 YEARS AND BECAUSE HE WORKED HARD MY  DAD WAS ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE  AND EVENTUALLY START HIS OWN  SMALL BUSINESS AND THEN SEND ME  OUT INTO THE WORLD TO FOLLOW MY  OWN DREAMS NO MATTER HOW FAR THOSE DREAMS  HAVE TAKEN ME I HAVE ALWAYS  REMEMBERED I AM THE DAUGHTER OF  A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND THE  GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY  WORKER AND PROUD OF BOTH SO HERE IS WHAT I WANT I WANT EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY TO  BE ABLE TO TELL THE SAME STORY IF YOU WORK HARD YOU DO YOUR  PART YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE YOUR CHILDREN ALL THE  OPPORTUNITIES THEY DESERVE THAT IS THE BASIC BARGAIN OF  AMERICA NOW WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO  RENEW THAT BARGAIN ON EVEN  BETTER TERMS FOR THE 21st  CENTURY DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION SO HERE ARE FOUR QUESTIONS THAT  I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL  ASK OF BOTH CANDIDATES AND THAT THE ANSWERS SHOULD HELP MAKE  YOUR CHOICE IN NOVEMBER CRYSTAL  CLEAR FIRST WHICH CANDIDATE HAS A  REAL PLAN TO CREATE GOOD PAYING  JOBS SECOND WHO WILL RESTORE  FAIRNESS TO OUR ECONOMY AND  ENSURE THAT THOSE AT THE TOP PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES THIRD WHO WILL REALLY GO TO BAT FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND FOURTH WHO CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO DELIVER THE RESULTS  THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN  YOUR LIVES NOW I HOPE THAT AFTER GIVING A  FAIR HEARING TO BOTH SIDES YOU  WILL JOIN THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY SUPPORTING  THIS CAMPAIGN NOT JUST  DEMOCRATS BUT A GROWING NUMBER  OF REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS  AS WELL NOW WHEN IT COMES TO CREATING  JOBS I WOULD ARGUE ITS NOT  EVEN CLOSE EVEN CONSERVATIVE EXPERTS SAY  TRUMPS AGENDA WILL PULL OUR  ECONOMY BACK INTO RECESSION ACCORDING TO AN INDEPENDENT  ANALYSIS BY A FORMER ECONOMIC  ADVISOR TO SENATOR JOHN McCAIN  IF YOU ADD UP ALL OF TRUMPS  IDEAS FROM CUTTING TAXES FOR THE WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS TO  STARTING A TRADE WAR WITH CHINA TO DEPORTING MILLIONS OF HARD  WORKING IMMIGRANTS THE RESULT  WOULD BE A LOSS OF 34 MILLION  JOBS NOW BY CONTRAST THE SAME  ANALYST FOUND THAT WITH OUR  PLANS THE ECONOMY WOULD CREATE  MORE THAN 10 MILLION NEW JOBS  SO LET ME TELL YOU HOW WE WOULD DO THAT I BELIEVE EVERY AMERICAN WILLING TO WORK HARD SHOULD BE ABLE TO  FIND A JOB THAT PROVIDES  DIGNITY PRIDE AND DECENT PAY  THAT CAN SUPPORT A FAMILY SO STARTING ON DAY ONE WE WILL  WORK WITH BOTH PARTIES TO PASS  THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN NEW  GOOD PAYING JOBS SINCE WORLD WAR II WE WILL PUT AMERICANS TO WORK  BUILDING AND MODERNIZING OUR  ROADS OUR BRIDGES OUR TUNNELS OUR RAILWAYS OUR PORTS OUR  AIR AIRPORTS WE ARE WAY OVERDUE FOR THIS MY  FRIENDS WE ARE LIVING OFF THE  INVESTMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY  OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS  GENERATIONS WE WILL ALSO HELP CITIES LIKE  DETROIT AND FLINT CONNECT  UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS TO  OPPORTUNITY EXPANDING  AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE WILL  REPAIR SCHOOLS AND FAILING WATER SYSTEMS AS WELL  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE   I HAPPEN TO THINK WE SHOULD BE  AMBITIOUS WHILE WERE AT IT LETS CONNECT EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA TO  BROADBAND BY THE YEAR 2020 ITS ASTONISHING TO ME HOW MANY  PLACES IN AMERICA NOT WAY WAY FAR AWAY FROM CITIES BUT IN  CITIES AND NEAR CITIES THAT  DONT HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND AND THAT DISADVANTAGES KIDS WHO  ARE ASKED TO DO HOMEWORK USING  THE INTERNET 5 MILLION OF THEM LIVE IN HOMES  WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET SO YOU TALK ABOUT AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP IT STARTS RIGHT THERE AND LETS BUILD A CLEANER MORE  RESILIENT POWER GRID WITH ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER EVERY  HOME IN OUR COUNTRY AS WELL SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE  CLEAN ENERGY SUPER POWER OF THE  21st CENTURY AND CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND BUSINESSES ITS PROBABLY GOING TO BE EITHER CHINA GERMANY OR AMERICA I WANT IT TO BE US WE INVENT THE TECHNOLOGY WE  SHOULD MAKE IT AND USE IT AND  EXPORT IT WHICH WILL HELP TO GROW OUR  ECONOMY AND HERES SOMETHING THAT YOU  DONT ALWAYS HEAR ENOUGH OF FROM DEMOCRATS A BIG PART OF OUR PLAN WILL BE  UNLEASHING THE POWER OF THE  PRIVATE SECTOR TO CREATE MORE  JOBS AT HIGHER PAY AND THAT MEANS FOR US CREATING  AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK TO GET  PRIVATE FUNDS OFF THE SIDELINES  AND COMPLEMENT OUR PRIVATE  INVESTMENTS 25 BILLION IN GOVERNMENT SEED  FUNDING COULD UNLOCK MORE THAN  250 BILLION AND REALLY GET OUR  COUNTRY MOVING ON OUR  INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS AND WERE GOING TO INVEST 10  BILLION IN WHAT WERE CALLING  MAKE IT IN AMERICA  PARTNERSHIPS TO SUPPORT AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND RECOMMIT TO  SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT CAN  CREATE ENTIRE NEW INDUSTRIES WHEN MARK AND JOHN WERE GIVING  ME THE TOUR AND I WAS TALKING  WITH SOME OF THE WORKERS ALONG  THE WAY AND ASKING THEM WHERE  SOME OF THE PRECISION MACHINERY  CAME FROM THAT IS BEING USED  HERE WHAT I HEAR ALL OVER THE  COUNTRY  GERMANY JAPAN  ITALY I WANT TO BRING THAT PRECISION  MANUFACTURING BACK TO THE UNITED STATES THERE IS NO REASON WE CANT  BEGIN TO MAKE THOSE MACHINES  OURSELVES AND SUPPLY THE REST OF THE WORLD INSTEAD OF BUYING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE LETS ALSO EXPAND INCENTIVES  LIKE THE NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS  THAT CAN BRING BUSINESSES  GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITIES  TOGETHER TO CREATE GOOD JOBS IN  PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT  AND LEFT BEHIND FROM NEGLECTED NEIGHBORHOODS IN  DETROIT AND FLINT TO LOGGING  COUNTRY COAL COUNTRY NATIVE  AMERICAN COMMUNITIES FROM RURAL AREAS RAVAGED BY ADDICTION AND  LOST JOBS TO INDUSTRIAL REGIONS  HOLLOWED OUT WHEN FACTORIES  CLOSED AS PRESIDENT I WILL ALSO MAKE A MAJOR PUSH TO EMPOWER SMALL  BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS  WITH NEW NATIONAL INITIATIVES TO CUT RED TAPE AT EVERY LEVEL AND  EXPAND ACCESS TO CREDIT  ESPECIALLY THROUGH COMMUNITY  BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS I WILL PROPOSE A IN NEW PLAN TO  DRAMATICALLY SIMPLIFY TAX FILING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW THE SMALLEST  BUSINESSES THE KIND THAT MY DAD HAD  BECAUSE IT WAS A REALLY  SMALL BUSINESS  SPENT 20 TIMES MORE PER EMPLOYEE TO PREPARE  THEIR TAXES COMPARED TO LARGER  COMPANIES IT SHOULD BE AS EASY AS PRINTING OUT A BANK STATEMENT LETS FREE ENTREPRENEURS TO DO  WHAT THEY DO BEST  INNOVATE  GROW AND HIRE AS MARK SAID THIS COMPANY  STARTED BECAUSE OF A DRIVE DOWN  A ROAD AND THINKING ABOUT IT  TALKING ABOUT IT THEN SEEING  ONE OF THE OLD OLDSMOBILE FUTURE AMICS IN AMERICA IF YOU SHOULD DREAM  IT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD  IT AND WERE GOING TO GET BACK TO  DOING THAT NOW DONALD TRUMP HAS A DIFFERENT VIEW HES MADE A CAREER OUT OF  STIFFING SMALL BUSINESSES FROM  ATLANTIC CITY TO LAS VEGAS THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT WERE  LEFT HANGING BECAUSE HE REFUSED  TO PAY THEIR BILLS A LOT OF THOSE COMPANIES SCRAPED TOGETHER WHAT THEY COULD TO PAY  THEIR EMPLOYEES AND MANY OF  THEM PUT THEIR BUSINESSES AT  RISK AND SOME OF THEM ENDED UP  TAKING BANKRUPTCY IT WASNT BECAUSE TRUMP COULDNT PAY THEM IT WAS BECAUSE HE WOULDNT PAY  THEM AND THATS WHY I TAKE IT  PERSONALLY MY DAD RAN A PRINTING PLANT HE HAD TWO REALLY LONG TABLES HE PRINTED FABRIC FOR DRAPERIES HE WOULD LAY OUT THE FABRIC  THEN HE WOULD TAKE A SILKSCREEN  AND HE WOULD GO DOWN THE TABLE HED PUT THE SILKSCREEN DOWN  HED POUR THE PAINT IN HED  TAKE THE SQUEEGEE HED GO  ACROSS THE SCREEN LIFT IT UP  GO DOWN GO DOWN START ON THE  END GO ALL THE WAY TO THE OTHER END HE WORKED HARD WHEN HE WAS DONE HED LOAD UP  ALL THAT FABRIC AND TAKE IT TO  THE BUSINESS WHO HAD ORDERED IT MAYBE A RESTAURANT A HOTEL OR  SOME OTHER OFFICE HE EXPECTED TO BE PAID WHEN HE  SHOWED UP HE DID THE WORK HE PAID FOR THE SUPPLIES AND THE LABOR THAT HE OFTEN HIRED TO  HELP HIM ON BIG JOBS HE EXPECTED TO BE PAID I CANT IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE  HAPPENED TO MY FATHER AND HIS  BUSINESS IF HE HAD GOTTEN A  CONTRACT FROM TRUMP AND SHOWING UP AND SUBMITTING  HIS BILL HAD BEEN TOLD WERE  NOT GOING TO PAY AND IF YOU DONT LIKE IT SUE  US MY FATHER NEVER COULD HAVE SUED  A BIG ORGANIZATION LIKE THAT I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND IT IVE MET ALL KINDS OF WORKERS  PAINTERS PLUMBERS I MET SMALL BUSINESSES THAT  PROVIDED PIANOS INSTALLED GLASS OR MARBLE ALL OF WHOM WERE  DENIED PAYMENT AND AFTER GOING BACK TIME AND  AGAIN BEING TOLD WELL MAYBE  WELL PAY YOU 30 CENTS ON THE  DOLLAR OR 50 CENTS ON THE  DOLLAR THATS NOT HOW WE DO BUSINESS IN AMERICA SO WEVE GOT TO CREATE MORE GOOD JOBS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP MORE PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE OUR MODERN SERVICE  ECONOMY IS EMPOWERING CONSUMERS  WITH MORE CHOICES AND GREATER  FLEXIBILITY BUT WE DO HAVE TO EMPOWER THE  WORKERS IN OUR SERVICE SECTOR  TOO THE PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF OUR  CHILDREN AND OUR PARENTS THEY DESERVE A GOOD WAGE AND  GOOD BENEFITS AND A SECURE  RETIREMENT AND ITS CRUCIAL THAT EVERY  AMERICAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE  EDUCATION AND SKILLS ANY NEED TO GET THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE SO WE WILL FIGHT TO MAKE COLLEGE  TUITIONFREE FOR THE MIDDLE  CLASS AND DEBTFREE FOR  EVERYONE WE WILL ALSO LIBERATE MILLIONS  OF PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE  STUDENT DEBT BY MAKING IT EASIER TO REFINANCE AND REPAY WHAT YOU  OWE AS A PORTION OF YOUR INCOME  SO YOU DONT HAVE TO PAY MORE  THAN YOU CAN AFFORD IT IS JUST NOT RIGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN IGNORE HIS DEBTS BUT  STUDENTS AND FAMILIES CANT  REFINANCE THEIR DEBT AND HERES SOMETHING ELSE THAT I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE I DONT THINK ANYBODY IN  AMERICAS TALKING ABOUT THIS  ENOUGH AND THAT IS A FOURYEAR DEGREE  SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY PATH TO A GOOD JOB IN AMERICA YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN A  SKILL PRACTICE A TRADE MAKE A  GOOD LIVING DOING IT SO MANY AMERICANS HAVE THE  TALENT AND THE WILL TO SUCCEED  WHETHER THEYRE KIDS RIGHT OUT  OF HIGH SCHOOL OR OLDER PEOPLE  DISPLACED BY AUTOMATION AND  OUTSOURCING AND FOR TOO LONG BIG PROMISES  HAVE THE POWER OF TRAINING AND  RETRAINING HAVENT DELIVERED  LIKE THEY SHOULD IT DOESNT HELP ANYBODY TO BE  TRAINED FOR A JOB THAT DOESNT  EXIST SO HERES WHAT WERE GOING TO  DO WE WILL SUPPORT HIGHQUALITY  UNION TRAINING PROGRAMS WE WILL PROPOSE  WE WILL  PROPOSE NEW TAX CREDITS TO  ENCOURAGE MORE COMPANIES TO  OFFER PAID APPRENTICESHIPS THAT  LET YOU EARN WHILE YOU LEARN WE WILL DO MORE INCLUDING A  NATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO DIGNIFY  SKILLS TRAINING ACROSS THE  BOARD I THINK WEVE GOT TO REVERSE  WHAT HAS BECOME A KIND OF COMMON PLACE VIEW WHICH IS EVERYBODY  NEEDS TO GO TO COLLEGE WELL IN FACT MORE THAN HALF OF THE JOBS THAT ARE GOING TO BE  AVAILABLE IN 2020 DO NOT REQUIRE A COLLEGE FOURYEAR DEGREE SO FOR WELDERS AND MACHINISTS  AND TOOL AND DIE MAKERS AND  HEALTH TECHNICIANS AND CODERS  AND SO MANY OTHERS LETS GET  THE WORD OUT THERE ARE REALLY  GOOD JOBS FOR PEOPLE RIGHT NOW  AND THERE WILL BE MORE IN THE  FUTURE IF YOU GET THE SKILLS IN  HIGH SCHOOL AT COMMUNITY  COLLEGE IN AN APPRENTICESHIP OR OTHER TRAINING PROGRAM AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE  GREAT ROLE THAT THE COMMUNITY  COLLEGE HERE AT McCOMB COUNTY  HAS PLAYED IN WORKING WITH  COMPANIES LIKE THIS ONE TO MAKE  SURE PEOPLE DO HAVE THE SKILLS NOW I IMAGINE SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING WELL THAT ALL  SOUNDS GOOD WELL WHAT ABOUT TRADE AFTER ALL TRUMP TALKS ABOUT IT  ALL THE TIME WELL LETS START WITH THIS IT IS TRUE THAT TOO OFTEN PAST  TRADE DEALS HAVE BEEN SOLD TO  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH ROSY  SCENARIOS THAT DID NOT PAN OUT THOSE PROMISES NOW RING HOLLOW  IN MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS  MICHIGAN AND OUR COUNTRY THAT  HAVE SEEN FACTORIES CLOSE AND  JOBS DISAPPEAR TOO MANY COMPANIES LOBBIED FOR  TRADE DEALS SO THEY COULD SELL  PRODUCTS ABROAD BUT THEN THEY  INSTEAD MOVED ABROAD AND SOLD  BACK INTO THE UNITED STATES IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT CHINA AND  OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE GAMD THE  S SYSTEM FOR TOO LONG ENFORCEMENT PARTICULARLY DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS  BEEN TOO LAX INVESTMENTS AT HOME THAT WOULD  MAKE US MORE COMPETITIVE HAVE  BEEN COMPLETELY BLOCKED IN  CONGRESS AND AMERICAN WORKERS AND  COMMUNITIES HAVE PAID THE PRICE BUT THE ANSWER IS NOT TO RANT  AND RAVE OR CUT OURSELVES OFF  FROM THE WORLD THAT WOULD END UP KILLING EVEN  MORE JOBS THE ANSWER IS TO FINALLY MAKE  TRADE WORK FOR US NOT AGAINST  US SO MY MESSAGE TO EVERY WORKER IN MICHIGAN AND ACROSS AMERICA IS  THIS  I WILL STOP ANY TRADE  DEAL THAT KILLS JOBS OR HOLDS  DOWN WAGES INCLUDING THE  TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP I OPPOSE IT NOW ILL OPPOSE IT  AFTER THE ELECTION AND ILL  OPPOSE IT AS PRESIDENT AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK I  FOUGHT TO DEFEND NEW YORKS  MANUFACTURERS AND STEEL MAKERS  FROM UNFAIR CHINESE TRADING  PRACTICES AND I OPPOSED THE  ONLY MULTILATERAL TRADE DEAL  THAT CAME BEFORE THE SENATE  WHILE I WAS THERE BECAUSE IT  DIDNT MEET MY HIGH BAR AND AS SECRETARY OF STATE I  FOUGHT HARD FOR AMERICAN  BUSINESSES TO GET A FAIR SHOT  AROUND THE WORLD AND TO STOP  UNDERHANDED TRADING PRACTICES  LIKE CURRENCY MANIPULATION AND  THE THEFT OF INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY SO AS PRESIDENT I WILL STAND UP TO CHINA AND ANYONE ELSE WHO  TRIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF  AMERICAN WORKERS AND COMPANIES IM GOING TO RAMP UP ENFORCEMENT BY APPOINTING FOR THE FIRST TIME A CHIEF TRADE PROSECUTOR I WILL TRIPLE THE NUMBER OF  ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND WHEN COUNTRIES BREAK THE  RULES WE WONT HESITATE TO  IMPOSE TARGETED TARIFFS NOW MR TRUMP MAY TALK A BIG  GAME ON TRADE BUT HIS APPROACH  IS BASED ON FEAR NOT STRENGTH FEAR THAT WE CANT COMPETE WITH  THE REST OF THE WORLD EVEN WHEN THE RULES ARE FAIR FEAR THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS NO  CHOICE BUT TO HIDE BEHIND WALLS IF TEAM USA WAS AS FEARFUL AS  TRUMP MICHAEL PHELPS AND SIMONE BILES WOULD BE COWERING IN THE  LOCKER ROOM AFRAID TO COME OUT  AND COMPETE INSTEAD THEYRE WINNING GOLD  MEDALS AMERICA ISNT AFRAID TO COMPETE RIGHT NOW THOUSANDS OF MICHIGAN  COMPANIES ARE EXPORTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PRODUCTS AROUND  THE WORLD WE WANT THEM TO SELL EVEN MORE  AND CREATE EVEN MORE JOBS HERE  AT HOME BUT CORPORATIONS SHOULD NOT  ABANDON PROFITABLE OPERATIONS  HERE IN THE UNITED STATES TO  MOVE ABROAD JUST TO GIVE  SHAREHOLDERS A QUICKER RETURN CEOs A BIGGER BONUS AND UNIONS A WEAKER HAND TO  PLAY NOW BEFORE HE TWEETS    LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE    ABOUT HOW HES REALLY THE ONE WHO WILL PUT AMERICA FIRST IN  TRADE LETS REMEMBER WHERE  TRUMP MAKES MANY OF HIS OWN  PRODUCTS BECAUSE IT SURE IS NOT AMERICA HES MADE TRUMP TIES IN CHINA  AND TRUMP SUITS IN MEXICO  INSTEAD OF HERE IN MICHIGAN HE KEEPS SAYING ITS NOT  POSSIBLE TO MAKE THESE THINGS IN AMERICA ANYMORE THATS JUST WRONG SO WE CREATED A WEBSITE HILLARY HILLARYCLINTONCOMMAKE IT HERE ON IT ON IT WE LIST 100 PLACES  ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT  ARE ALREADY PRODUCING SIMILAR  GOODS NOW ONE POSITIVE THING TRUMP  COULD DO TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT  AGAIN IS ACTUALLY MAKE GREAT  THINGS IN AMERICA AGAIN  APPLAUSE   THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHICH  CANDIDATE WILL FIGHT FOR  FAIRNESS AND THIS IS AN URGENT  NEED WE NEED TO GROW THE ECONOMY AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT FAIRER THE TIDE IS NOT RISING FAST  ENOUGH AND IT IS CERTAINLY NOT  LIFTING ALL VOTES SINCE THE CRASH TOO MANY OF THE GAINS HAVE GONE TO THE TOP 1 THE RULES AND INCENTIVES IN OUR  SYSTEM REWARD CORPORATIONS FOR  PUTTING SHORTTERM STOCK PRICES  ABOVE LONGTERM INVESTMENTS AND  THEIR WORKERS EQUIPMENT AND  RESEARCH WHILE CORPORATE PROFITS ARE AT  NEARRECORD HIGHS PAYCHECKS FOR MOST PEOPLE HAVE BARELY BUDGED INCOMES ARENT GROWING FAST  ENOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH THE COSTS OF LIVING LIKE PRESCRIPTION  DRUGS AND CHILD CARE I BELIEVE THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE  FROM THE CEO SUITE TO THE  FACTORY FLOOR CONTRIBUTES TO A  BUSINESS SUCCESS SO EVERYBODY SHOULD SHARE IN THE REW REWARDS ESPECIALLY THOSE  PUTTING IN LONG HOURS FOR LITTLE PAY SO IM PROPOSING A NEW TAX  CREDIT TO ENCOURAGE MORE  COMPANIES TO SHARE PROFITS WITH  WORKERS AND MORE BROADLY WE  WILL FIGHT FOR A MORE  PROGRESSIVE MORE PATRIOTIC TAX  CODE THAT PUTS AMERICAN JOBS  FIRST RIGHT NOW WHEN A CORPORATION  OUTSOURCES JOBS AND PRODUCTION  IT COULD WRITE OFF THE COSTS WE MUST STOP THAT AND WE MUST  MAKE THEM PAY BACK ANY TAX  BREAKS THEY EVER RECEIVED FROM  ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT IN OUR  COUNTRY AND FOR THOSE THAT MOVE THEIR  HEADQUARTERS OVERSEAS TO AVOID  PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF  TAXES THEYRE GOING TO HAVE TO  PAY A NEW EXIT TAX IF THEY WANT TO GO THEYRE  GOING TO HAVE TO PAY TO GO  APPLAUSE   AND WALL STREET CORPORATIONS AND THE SUPER RICH SHOULD FINALLY  PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES THATS WHY I SUPPORT THE  SOCALLED BUFFETT RULE BECAUSE MULTIMILLIONAIRES  SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY A  LOWER TAX RATE THAN THEIR  SECRETARIES WE SHOULD ALSO ADD A NEW TAX ON  MULTIMILLIONAIRES CRACKDOWN ON TAX GAMING BY  CORPORATIONS AND CLOSE THE  CARRIED INTEREST LOOPHOLE  SOMETHING I HAVE ADVOCATING FOR  YEARS NOW COMPARE WHAT TRUMP SAYS NOW THERE IS A MYTH OUT THERE  THAT HE WILL STICK IT TO THE  RICH AND POWERFUL BECAUSE  SOMEHOW HES REALLY ON THE SIDE  OF THE LITTLE GUY DONT BELIEVE IT NOT WHEN HE PLEDGES TO RIP UP  BASIC RULES THAT HOLD  CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE WHEN HE WANTS TO SCRAP  REGULATIONS THAT STOP POLLUTERS  FROM POISONING THE AIR OUR  CHILDREN BREATHE AND THE WATER  WE DRINK LET INSURANCE COMPANIES WRITE  THEIR OWN RULES AGAIN TRUMP WOULD ROLL BACK THE TOUGH  RULES THAT WE HAVE IMPOSED ON  THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY ILL DO THE OPPOSITE I THINK WE SHOULD STRENGTHEN  THOSE RULES SO WALL STREET CAN  NEVER WRECK MAIN STREET AGAIN  APPLAUSE   TRUMP EVEN WANTS TO ABOLISH THE  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION  BUREAU A NEW AGENCY THAT HAS  ALREADY RETURNED MORE THAN 11  BILLION TO 25 MILLION AMERICANS  WHO WERE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY  CORPORATIONS WHY WOULD YOU GET RID OF THAT AND THEN THERE IS TRUMPS TAX  PLAN HE WOULD GIVE TRILLIONS IN TAX  CUTS TO BIG CORPORATIONS  MILLIONAIRES AND WALL STREET  MONEY MANAGERS THAT WOULD EXPLODE OUR NATIONAL  DEBT AND EVENTUALLY LEAD TO  MASSIVE CUTS IN PRIORITIES LIKE  EDUCATION HEALTH CARE AND  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN HIS SPEECH ON MONDAY HE  CALLED FOR A NEW TAX LOOPHOLE LETS CALL IT THE TRUMP  LOOPHOLE BECAUSE TWO ALLOW HIM TO PAY  LESS THAN HALF THE CURRENT TAX  RATE ON INCOME FROM MANY OF HIS  COMPANIES HED PAY A LOWER RATE THAN  MILLIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS  FAMILIES ONE NONPARTISAN EXPERT AT THE  TAX POLICY CENTER DESCRIBED THIS PLAN AS AS I QUOTE A REALLY  NICE DEAL FOR DONALD TRUMP OF COURSE ITS HARD TO SAY HOW  NICE BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO DO  WHAT EVERY OTHER PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE IN DECADES HAS DONE  AND RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE   BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE 400  RICHEST TAXPAYERS IN AMERICA  WOULD GET AN AVERAGE TAX CUT OF  MORE THAN 15 MILLION A YEAR  FROM THE TRUMP LOOPHOLE AND THEN THERE IS THE ESTATE TAX WHICH TRUMP WANTS TO ELIMINATE  ALL TOGETHER NOW IF YOU BELIEVE THAT HES AS  WEALTHY AS HE SAYS THAT ALONE  WOULD SAVE THE TRUMP FAMILY 4  BILLION IT WOULD DO NOTHING FOR 998 OF AMERICANS SO THEYD GET A 4 BILLION TAX  CUT AND 998 OF AMERICANS  WOULD GET NOTHING JUST THINK OF WHAT WE COULD DO  WITH THOSE 4 BILLION WE COULD PAY FOR MORE THAN  47000 VETERANS TO GET A  FOURYEAR COLLEGE DEGREE WE COULD PROVIDE A YEARS WORTH  OF HEALTH CARE TO NEARLY 3  MILLION KIDS OR WE COULD FUND A YEARS WORTH  OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO STATE  AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF  BETTER WAYS TO SPEND THE MONEY ON MONDAY IM GOING TO BE IN  SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA WITH VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HE HAS A SAYING DONT TELL ME  WHAT YOU VALUE SHOW ME YOUR BUDGET AND I WILL  TELL YOU WHAT YOU VALUE WE WELL DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO GIVE TRILLIONS IN TAX BREAKS TO  PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF I WANT TO INVEST IT IN VETERANS OUR KIDS OUR POLICE OFFICERS  AND SO MUCH MORE AND YOU CAN THEN DRAW YOUR OWN  CONCLUSION ABOUT VALUES NOW ITS TRUE THAT BOTH OF US  HAVE PROPOSED TO CUT TAXES FOR  MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES HES MAKING A BIG PROMISE BUT HIS ADVISORS HAVE SAID   HIS OWN ADVISORS HAVE SAID HE  MAY NOT STAND BY THEM INSTEAD THE TAX CUTS HE DOUBLED DOWN ON IN HIS SPEECH IN DETROIT ON MONDAY OFFERED TRILLIONS TO  THE RICHEST AMERICANS AND  CORPORATIONS WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND ME IS IM  TELLING YOU WHAT I WILL DO IM  LAYING OUT MY PLANS AND I WILL  STAND BY THEM AND WANT YOU TO  HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE FOR  DELIVERING RESULTS THIS ALL REMINDS ME OF THAT OLD  SAYING IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT PROBABLY IS THAT BRINGS US TO THE THIRD  QUESTION WHICH CANDIDATE CAN YOU ACTUALLY COUNT ON TO GO TO BAT FOR  WORKERS AND WORKING FAMILIES IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO PAY LIP  SERVICE TO BEING ON YOUR SIDE WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE HOW  AMERICANS ACTUALLY LIVE AND WORK IN THE 21st CENTURY AND NEN  OFFER REAL SOLUTIONS THAT MAKE  YOUR LIVES EASIER WE KNOW THAT WOMEN ARE NOW THE  SOLE OR PRIMARY BREADWINNER IN A GROWING NUMBER OF FAMILIES WE KNOW MORE AMERICANS ARE  COBBLING TOGETHER PARTTIME WORK OR STRIKING OUT ON THEIR OWN SO WE HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO  BE GOOD WORKERS GOOD PARENTS  AND GOOD CAREGIVERS ALL AT THE  SAME TIME THATS WHY IVE SET OUT A BOLD  VISION TO MAKE QUALITY  AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE AVAILABLE  TO ALL AMERICANS AND LIMIT THE  COST TO 10 OF FAMILY INCOME  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE   ON MONDAY TRUMP OFFERED HIS  FIRST REAL IDEAS ON THIS TOPIC BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY HE HAD  DISMISSED CONCERNS ABOUT CHILD  CARE HE SAID IT WAS QUOTE NOT AN  EXPENSIVE THING BECAUSE YOU JUST NEED SOME BLOCKS AND SOME  SWINGS NOW HE SAYS HE WANTS TO EXCLUDE  CHILD CARE PAYMENTS FROM  TAXATION HIS PLAN WAS PAN FROM THE LEFT  THE RIGHT THE CENTER BECAUSE  IT TRANSPARENTLY IS DESIGNED FOR RICH PEOPLE LIKE HIM HE WOULD GIVE WEALTHY FAMILIES  30 CENTS OR 40 CENTS ON THE  DOLLAR FOR THEIR NANNIES AND  LITTLE OR NOTHING FOR MILLIONS  OF HARD WORKING FAMILIES TRYING  TO AFFORD CHILD CARE SO THAT  THEY CAN GET TO WORK AND KEEP  THE JOB  APPLAUSE   I THINK INSTEAD WE SHOULD  EXPAND THE CHILD TAX CREDIT TO  PROVIDE REAL RELIEF TO TENS OF  MILLIONS OF WORKING FAMILIES  STRUGGLING WITH THE COSTS OF  RAISING CHILDREN THE SAME FAMILIES THAT HIS PLAN  IGNORES THATS JUST A START BECAUSE THE MORE WE DO TO HELP  WORKING FAMILIES THE MORE OUR  ENTIRE ECONOMY WILL BENEFIT FOR EXAMPLE GUARANTEEING EQUAL  PAY WONT JUST INCREASE  PAYCHECKS FOR WOMEN IT WILL  BOOST FAMILY BUDGETS AND GET  INCOMES RISING ACROSS THE BOARD  APPLAUSE   I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY TRUMPS  AGAINST THAT PAID FAMILY LEAVE WONT ONLY  MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR MOMS AND  DADS IT WILL ALSO KEEP SKILLED TALENTED AMERICANS IN THE  WORKFORCE AND GROW OUR ECONOMY THATS WHY EVERY OTHER ADVANCED  COUNTRY ALREADY HAS IT AGAIN HES AGAINST IT RAISING THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE WONT JUST PUT MORE MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF LOWINCOME FAMILIES  IT ALSO MEANS THEY WILL SPEND  MORE AT THE BUSINESSES IN THEIR  NEIGHBORHOODS  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE   THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVEN THE  ORIGINAL AUTOMAKERS UNDERSTOOD  WAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20th CENTURY WHEN THEY DECIDED  TO PAY THE UNBELIEVABLE SUM OF  5 A DAY TO AUTO WORKERS AND WHEN THEY WERE CRITICIZED BY OTHER BUSINESSES HOW CAN YOU  PAY THAT MUCH THEY HAD THE BEST ANSWER  WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE  ABLE TO BUY OUR CARS THIS IS ECONOMICS 101 WE NEED TO GET INCOMES AND WAGES RISING AND IT WILL HELP THE  WHOLE ECONOMY GROW AND BE  FAIRER  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE   AND PROTECTING AND EXPANDING  SOCIAL SECURITY DOESNT JUST  HELP OLDER AMERICANS RETIRE WITH DIGNITY IT HELPS TO EASE  BURDENS ON FAMILIES AND  COMMUNITIES AND I ALSO BELIEVE THE SAME  THING ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE  IMOPE IMMIGRATION REFORM WE ALREADY HAVE MILLIONS OF  PEOPLE WORKING IN THE ECONOMY  AND PAYING 12 BILLION A YEAR TO SOCIAL SECURITY EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDOCUMENTED SO BY MOVING TOWARD REFORM WE  WILL UNLEASH A LOT OF NEW INCOME AND GROWTH AND WE WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT AMERICAN  WORKERS CANT BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BECAUSE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS  CAN BE EXPLOITED BY EMPLOYERS  WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE  HAVE THIS DISCONNECT AND FINALLY STRENGTHENING  UNIONS DOESNT JUST SERVE  MEMBERS IT LEADS TO BETTER PAY AND  BENEFITS AND WORKING CONDITIONS  FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IVE ALSO SAID I WILL DEFEND AND IMPROVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND FOR ME THAT INCLUDES GIVING AMERICANS IN EVERY STATE THE  CHOICE OF A PUBLIC OPTION HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN THAT WILL HELP  EVERYBODY AFFORD COVERAGE IT WILL STRENGTHEN COMPETITION  AND DRIVE DOWN COSTS NOW THESE ARE ALL CAUSES IVE  WORKED ON FOR DECADES AND I  BELIEVE THEY POINT TO A  FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH ABOUT OUR  ECONOMY IT CAN SEEM LIKE A ZERO SUM WHEN YOU ARE COMPETING FOR A JOB A  PROMOTION OR A CONTRACT IF  SOMEONE WINS AND SOMEONE LOSES BUT THAT IS NOT THE FULL  PICTURE IF YOU STEP BACK YOULL SEE  WERE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER IF WE CAN GROW TOGETHER WE CAN  ALL RISE TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE TO SAY  WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER AND THATS WHY THE FOURTH  QUESTION  THE FOURTH QUESTION  IS KEY AND ITS THIS WHO CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO GET ANY OF THIS DONE RIGHT WELL I BELIEVE I CAN BECAUSE I THINK I CAN PROVIDE SERIOUS  STEADY LEADERSHIP THAT CAN FIND  COMMON GROUND AND BUILD ON IT  BASED ON HARD BUT RESPECTFUL  BARGAINING WITH THE OTHER SIDE LEADERSHIP THAT RISES ABOVE  PERSONAL ATTACKS AND NAME  CALLING NOT REVELS IN IT I JUST DONT THINK INSULTS AND  BULLYING IS HOW WERE GOING TO  GET THINGS DONE AND I DONT THINK THAT THATS  THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH FOR US I KNOW ITS HARD TO IMAGINE BUT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN DEMOCRATS  AND REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY WORKED  TOGETHER I KNOW THATS TRUE  APPLAUSE   I DID IT AS FIRST LADY SENATOR  AND SECRETARY OF STATE ITS HOW WE CREATED THE  CHILDRENS HEALTH INSURANCE  PROGRAM WHICH COVERS 8 MILLION  KIDS  APPLAUSE   ITS HOW WE REBUILT NEW YORK  AFTER 911 AND HOW WE PASSED A  TREATY REDUCING THE THREAT FROM  RUSSIAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS SO I AM CONVINCED BASED ON MY  EXPERIENCE THAT WE CAN DO THIS AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I  ASKED SENATOR TIM KAINE TO BE MY RUNNING MATE IS THAT HE ALSO HAS A RECORD OF WORKING ACROSS THE  AISLE TO GET THINGS DONE AS A  MAYOR A GOVERNOR AND A  SENATOR SO WERE GOING TO MAKE FULL USE  OF THE WHITE HOUSES POWER TO  CONVENE WERE GOING TO GET EVERYONE AT  THE TABLE NOT JUST REPUBLICANS  AND DEMOCRATS BUT BUSINESSES  AND LABOR UNIONS ACADEMICS  EXPERTS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY AMERICANS LIKE ALL OF YOU  CHEERS AN APPLAUSE   I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT IDEAS OUT IN AMERICA AND I WANT YOU TO HAVE A SAY IN YOUR  GOVERNMENT AND THAT MEANS WEVE GOT TO GET  UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY OUT OF  POLITICS OVERTURN CITIZENS  UNITED AND EXPAND VOTING RIGHTS NOT RESTRICT THEM  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE   I INTEND EVEN STARTING BEFORE  THE ELECTION TO BRING TOGETHER  LEADERS FROM ACROSS OUR ECONOMY FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES  TO TALK ABOUT JOBS AND  COMPETITIVENESS AND I HOPE MARK  AND JOHN CAN JOIN ME BECAUSE WE NEED THE BEST IDEAS THAT ARE OUT THERE MAKING A DIFFERENCE WE NEED TO PULL TOGETHER THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO  BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR  EVERYONE NOT JUST THOSE AT THE  T TOP  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE   BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE  TRUMP CAMPAIGN HE WANTS AMERICA TO WORK FOR HIM AND HIS FRIENDS  AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE HES OFFERED NO CREDIBLE PLANS  TO ADDRESS WHAT WORKING FAMILIES ARE UP AGAINST TODAY NOTHING ON STUDENT LOANS OR THE  COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS NOTHING FOR FARMERS OR  STRUGGLING RURAL COMMUNITIES NOTHING TO BUILD A NEW FUTURE  WITH CLEAN ENERGY AND ADVANCED  AGRICULTURE NOTHING FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN OUR CITIES TO OVERCOME  BARRIERS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM NOTHING TO CREATE NEW  OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE JUST A MORE EXTREME VERSION OF  THE FAILED THEORY OF  TRICKLEDOWN ECONOMICS WITH HIS  OWN EDITION OF OUTLANDISH  TRUMPIAN IDEAS THAT EVEN  REPUBLICANS REJECT  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE   AND AS WE HEARD HIM SAY AT HIS  CONVENTION HE MAY BELIEVE THAT  HE ALONE CAN FIX OUR COUNTRY BUT CLEARLY HE DOESNT KNOW THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN HE DOESNT SEE THE BUSINESSES  AND THE LABOR UNIONS THE LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS THE CLERGY COMING  TOGETHER EVERY SINGLE DAY TO  MAKE THINGS BETTER SO YES THERE IS STILL A LONG  ROAD AHEAD BUT MICHIGAN IS ON THE RISE AND EVERYONE IS CONTRIBUTING THATS AMERICA AT ITS BEST SO I HOPE YOU WILL STAY ACTIVE  AND ENGAGED AND WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE JOBS AND TO STRENGTHEN YOUR OWN COMMUNITIES AND I HOPE YOU WILL WORK TO GET  OUT THE VOTE IN NOVEMBER BECAUSE IF WE    CHEERS AND APPLAUSE   IF WE ARE ABLE TO WIN THEN I  WANT YOU ALL TO WORK WITH ME TO  BUILD THE KIND OF PROGRESS THAT  AMERICA DESERVES TO SEE WERE GOING TO DO THIS TOGETHER WE ARE
