 big problem here the problem is its true europress youre oppressed youre oppressed youre oppressed god only knows why maybe youre too short or youre not as beautiful as you could be or you know your parent your grandparent with a serf likely because almost everybodys grand great grandparent was its like you know and youre not as smart as you could be and you have a sick relative and you have your own physical problems and its like frankly youre a mess and youre oppressed in every possible way including your ancestry and your biology and the entire sum of human history has conspired to produce victimized you with all your individual pathological problems its like yes true okay but the problem is is that it is true and so if you take me oppressed you have to fractionate them and fractionate them its like youre a woman yeah okay well Im a black woman well Im a black woman who has two children well Im a black woman who has two children and one of them isnt very healthy and then while Im uh Im a Hispanic woman and I have a genius son who doesnt have any money so that he cant go to university and you know I had a hell of a time getting across the border it was really hard on me to get my citizenship my husband is an alcoholic brute its like well yeah that sucks too and so well so lets lets lets fix all your oppressive oppression and well take every single thing into account and then well fix yours too well take every single thing into account like no you wont because you cant you cant it is technically impossible first of all you cant even list all the ways that youre oppressed second how are you going to wait them third whos going to decide and thats the bloody thing whos going to decide thats the thing well whats the answer in the West its like in free markets oh yeah Christ will never bill to solve this problem no one can solve it what are we going to do about that were going to outsource it to the marketplace youre going to take your sorry pathetic being and youre going to try to offer me something that maybe I want and Im going to take my sorry pathetic being and Im going to say well all things considered as well as I can understand them maybe I could give you this much money which is actually a promise for that thing and youve packed all of your damn oppression into the price and I packed all my oppression into the willingness to pay it and that solution sucks its a bad solution but compared to every other solution man its why 10 of us have freedom and so theres a tremendous iya logic at the bottom of this its like you have to fractionate the oppressed all the way down to the level of the individual oh thats what the West figured out you know theres a couple of figures who asked the mythological roots of our culture and you know people get upset with me because I bring in religious themes but I understand some things about mythology and religion and its not an accident that the axiomatic Western individual is someone who is unfairly nailed to a cross and tortured its like yes right exactly so what do you do about that well I thought about that for a long time too its like well you dont get together in a damn Bob because all that does is allow you to be as horrible as you could possibly imagine and suffer from none of the consequences thats a bad idea so how about we dont do that well theres a deep idea in the West too its like pick up your damned suffering and bear it and try to be a good person so you dont make it worse well thats a truth you know I read a lot about the terrible things that people have done to each other you just cannot even imagine it its so awful so you dont want to be someone like that now do you have a reason to be yes you have a lots of reasons to be god theres reasons to be resentful about your existence everyone you know is going to die you know you too and theres going to be a fair bit of pain along the way and lot of its going to be unfair its like yeah no wonder youre resentful its like act it out and see what happens you make everything youre complaining about infinitely worse theres this idea that hell is a bottomless pit and thats because no matter how bad is some stupid sonofabitch like you could figure out a way to make it a lot worse so you think well what do you do about that well you accept it thats what life is like its suffering thats what the religious people have always said life is suffering yes well who wants to admit that well just think about it well so when you do in the face of that suffering try to reduce it start with yourself what good are you get yourself together for Christs sake so that when your father dies youre not whining away in the corner and you can help plan the funeral and you can stand up solidly so that people can rely on you thats better youll be a damn victim course youre a victim Jesus obviously put yourself together and then maybe if you put yourself together you know how to do that you know whats wrong with you if youll admit it you know theres a few things you could like polish up a little bit that you might even be able to manage in your insufficient present condition and so you might shine yourself up a little bit and then your eyes will be a little more open then you can shine yourself up a little bit more and then maybe you could bring your family together instead of having them be the hateful spiteful neurotic infighting batch that youre like doomed to spend Christmas with so then you fix yourself up a little bit kind of humbly because you know God youre a fixerupper if there ever was one and then you got to figure out well can you figure out how to make peace with your idiot brother and probably not because he just is done with you so how the hell are you going to manage that and so then you maybe you get somewhere that way in your family sort of functioning and you find out well that kind of relieved a little bit of suffering although it reduce the opportunities for spiteful revenge and thats kind of a pain in the neck and so then you get your family together a little bit and youre a little clued in then at least a bit because youve done something difficult thats actually difficult youre a wiser and so then maybe you could put a tentative finger out beyond the family and try to change some little thing without wrecking it its like our society is complex and we teach our stew that they could just fix it its like go fix a military helicopter and see how far you get with that its like youre going to get to do youre like a chimp with a reg wack hole look its better like no its not better things are complicated and to fix things is really hard and you have to be like a Goldie tool to fix things and youre not so and thats the other message of the West its like how do you overcome the suffering of the of life and Im not saying its only the message of the West how do you overcome the suffering of life is be a better person thats how you do it well thats hard it takes responsibility and I think you know if you said to someone you want to have a meaningful life everything you do matters thats the definition of a meaningful life but everything you do matters its gonna have to carry that with you or if you want to just forget about the whole meaning thing and then you dont have any responsibility because who the hell cares and you can wander through life doing whatever you want gratifying impulsive desires for how well useful thats going to be and youre stuck in meaninglessness but you dont have any responsibilities which one do you want well ask yourself which one are you pursuing and youll find very rapidly that it isnt the majority of your soul thats pursuing the whole meaning thing because but look what you have to do to do that you have to take on the fact that life is suffering you put yourself together in the face of that well thats hard Christ its amazing people can even do it Im stunned every day when I go outside and it isnt a riot with everything burning it can really God you talk to people its like I knew this guy hed been in a motorcycle accident and it really ruined him and he was like a linesman you know working on the power and he was working with someone who had Parkinsons disease and they had complementary inadequacies and so two of them could do the job of one person and so theyre out there fixing power lines in the freezing cold despite the fact that one was 34 wrecked with a motorcycle accident the other one has Parkinsons its like thats how our civilization works its like theres all these ruined people out there theyve got problems like you cant believe off they go to work and do things they dont even like and look the lights are on my god its unbelievable its its a miracle its a miracle and were so ungrateful college students the postmodern types theyre so ungrateful you know they dont know that theyre surrounded by just a bloody miracle its a miracle that all this stuff works but all you crazy chimpanzees who dont know each other can sit in the same room for two hours sweltering away without tearing each other apart because thats what chimps do so anyways so what happened while I made some videos and I got to the bottom of some things at least as far as I can tell so I told you what the bottom is and then I got this idea about what you might do about it which isnt my idea like its not my idea its an old old old old idea its far older than Christianity its old its the oldest story of mankind get yourself together transcend your suffering see if you can be some kind of hero make the suffering in the world less well thats the way forward as far as I can tell if there is any way forward thats whats under assault by the postmodernist so look out because they know exactly what theyre doing and they know exactly why theyre doing it and thats what it looks like to me so thats it Applause
