 Music I go we begin by thanking all of you love you tow let me let me thank all of you for coming out this afternoon let me think a brush for that introduction is I think all of you know of bob was one of the great secretaries of labor in the history of the United States and is a phenomenal educator not only here at Berkeley but his writings are getting all over the country so Bob thank you so much for all that you do I want to talk a little bit about the book but I suspect there are one or two other things on your minds as well so ill touch on touch on those things are number one Donald Trump lost the popular vote by over two million votes and the importance of that is that you have got to know and sometimes even our delusional presidentelect has got to understand that he does not have a mandate he does not have a mandate number two and even more importantly on every major issue facing this country poll after poll shows that the American people prefer a progressive agenda in other words the in other words there is a time and a place where somebody could say well you dont want nobody agrees with me but Im going to stand with this position Im right and thats fine but on every major issue facing this country the American people want progressive change the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage Applause thats not me thats not you that is the American people the American people overwhelmingly believe it is absurd that in the year 2016 women are making seventynine cents on the dollar compared to men they want pay equity the American people understand there is something profoundly wrong when in a highly competitive global economy we have a dysfunctional childcare prek system hundreds of thousands of bright young people are unable to afford to go to college millions leave school deeply in debt the American people want public colleges and universities to be tuition free at brought the substantially lower student debt again I say that not because its a good idea its an idea that i believe to be right or that most of you believe to be right it is what the American people want the American people Republicans and Democrats think that it is absurd and grossly unfair that billionaires like Donald Trump in a given year pay nothing in federal income tax and that many multinational corporations making billions in profit pay nothing in taxes the American people want progressive tax reform the American people where they are republican conservative moderate Democrat progressives understand that our current campaign finance system is corrupt and the American people understand that too many people too many brave Americans have fought and died to preserve Irv American democracy and that it is wrong that a handful of billionaires are now able to spend as a result of citizens united unlimited sums of money to buy elections the American people know democracy is oneperson onevote not billionaires buying elections and the American people understand that with 11 million undocumented people in this country many of them working tirelessly many of them getting ripped off on the job because they have no legal protection the American people do believe that we need to move to comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship again thats not my idea im not here telling you what i think i am telling you what the american people believe the American people know and some conservatives actually have been strong on this issue that is totally insane that we have more people in jail today than any other country on earth more than China four times our size we are spending eighty billion dollars a year locking up 22 million americans and whether youre conservative or progressive you understand that makes a hell of a lot more sense investing in jobs and education rather than jails and incarceration Applause now I say that to tell you that we in terms of our views are the majority and that many many people who voted for Trump for whatever reason support virtually everything that I have just listed off now as we move into the Trump era let me just say the following there are areas i think there can be some compromise there are areas where there can be no compromise and the area of first concern where they cannot and must be compromised is beating back the Trump campaign where the cornerstone of that campaign was bigotry no compromise with bigotry no compromise with racism with sexism with homophobia with xenophobia on that issue we will not compromise i dont have to explain to anybody here at this great University the painful and rocky road that this country has traveled with regard to all forms of bigotry starting before this country even became a country when the first settlers came here and did terrible awful things to the Native American people awful terrible things which continued to this day Applause and I dont have to tell anybody hear about the abomination of slavery or the fact that africanamericans did not have the right to vote in many states in this country I dont have to explain to anybody here because you all know history that a hundred years ago today women in America were not running for president they did not have the right to vote and I dont have to explain to people here that a hundredplus years ago children of 10 12 years of age were working in factories losing their fingers and their hands working on machinery that children should not have been new but as a result of the struggles in all of these areas and in other areas if we were sitting here five years ago eight years ago and somebody jumped up and said you know burning i think by the 2015 gay marriage will be legal in every state in this country the rest of the audience would have told that person youre crazy it cant happen it did happen because people stood up and fought back Applause so two points two points that I want to make in that regard number one this country through incredibly brave people some of home went to jail were beaten some of whom died this country has made significant improvements in becoming a less discriminatory society that we still have racism and sexism homophobia of course we do but we should be proud of the progress that we have made if we were here 20 years ago leaving and somebody jumps up as were gonna have an africanamerican president in 2008 reelected four years later the good vote people would have thought that would have been impossible we have made progress in becoming a less discriminatory society and what I say to miss the drop we are not going backwards were going forwards Applause so no compromise on bigotry none at all second area that I think we have got to be very attentive to and where I also believe that they just cannot be any compromise mr Trump campaigns all over the country and tells the American people that climate change is a hoax well miss the Trump you got to start listening to scientists and not just the fossil fuel industry climate change is NOT a hoax it is a painful dangerous reality climate change is real it is caused by human activity it is already as most of you know already causing horrific problems in our country and around the world what we are talking about is the future of the planet what we are talking about are the kind of lives that our kids and our grandchildren and future generations will experience we as human beings along with people all over this globe we are the custodians of this hour only planet we cannot turn our backs on this planet we are going to take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system Applause and the third area where I think there cannot be any compromise is the very nature of American democracy now what democracy is about is sometimes you win elections and sometimes you lose elections but where we are moving right now are two areas of great concern number one as a result of citizens united as i just mentioned billionaires can now spend unlimited sums of money to buy elections what all of you should know is that for the Koch brothers and for the billionaire class in general and for the leadership of the Republican Party citizens united has not gone far enough right now what citizens united means is the Koch brothers and other billionaires can spend unlimited sums of money in terms of quoteunquote independent expenditures so they can put all the ads they want and the wall kinds of other things independently of the candidate they are supporting what they want to do and theyre very upfront about it is end all forms of campaign finance regulation they want to move toward the day when the Koch brothers can give a check to and individuals like somebodys running for the Senate in California give that person directly a check for a half a billion dollars or 300 million whatever it may be and say there is your campaign manager theres your speech right out there is a media consultant you work for me you are my employee my money I own you that is where the Republican Party is moving second of all equally important when Trump sends out a delusional tweet the other day and I mean the word delusional which says I Donald Trump would have won the popular vote or did win the popular vote except for the fact that millions of people voted illegally that is an insane statement but I mean its not just not backed up by any fact nobody no Republican believes that nobody believes that but i think i understand what he was really saying what he was really sending out was a message to republican operatives and governors and so forth that you go forward aggressively in voter suppression so right now you have all over this country states which have worked overtime as a result of a disastrous Supreme Court decision some years ago which gutted the Voting Rights Act and they will try to make it harder for people of color for poor people for all people for young people to participate in the political process so you add those two things together them one billionaires buying elections number to a major effort at the state level and maybe at the national level trying to make it harder for people to vote you will have the Republican dream of democracy money buying elections and people in opposition to their ideas not being able to vote people in this country as i said before have fought and died to defend American democracy and I tell mr Trump and his friends we will not surrender American democracy democracy is one person one vote we are going to make it easier for people to participate in the political process not harder and our goal is public funding of elections that billionaires buying elections Applause Music Applause so among many are the issues many other issues of great concern to you and to me those are three where I just dont see any room for compromise not compromise on bigotry not compromise on climate change and not compromise on protecting American democracy now a lot of people are asking uh I dont happen had to miss the Trump win and are one of the things that exist not a good thing in our countries we live in a silo eyes society where we all talk to our friends people who share our views by and large so there are many people who say God I dont know how Trump could have one nobody I know body from and then there are Trumps supporters and say I cant believe the clinton got two million more votes the truck nobody I know voted for Clinton and in a sense of both groups all right but i do want to tell you of one of the reasons one of the reasons that i think trump one now it is easy to say and Ive heard a lot of people saying well you know everybody who voted for Trump is a racist or sexist towards fo I dont believe that I mean theres some people do believe it i dont believe it some of those people definitely did book the trumpet with seeing eruptions of that and we got a deal with that but i would say that the majority probably the strong majority of people who voted for Trump I not racist and theyre not sexist what they responded to is Trumps claim and this is just how crazy things are his claim a multi billionaire who doesnt pay any taxes that he is going to take on the establishment alright and the way I interpret that and Im working hard and I need your help on this issue is that i dont see this as a victory for Trump as much as i see it as a defeat for the present democratic party every party Music Applause you know what Democrats were talking about and rightly so is they say look a the economy today we just had some good statistics come out literally today lower unemployment the economy today is better than it was eight years ago democrats are proud of that proud of Obamas achievements and so forth thats true and its fair enough but there is a major point that many Democrats missed the mr Trump did not miss and that is that while the economy today maybe better than it was eight years ago the truth is that for the last 40 years on the Democratic and Republican administrations we have seen a middle class which is shrinking that today we have 43 million people living in poverty and that we have more income and wealth inequality today something Bob rights talks about a whole lot more income and wealth inequality than any time since 1928 and Trump understood that reality what Trump was talking to is the fact that median household income that family right in the middle of our economy today is earning about fourteen hundred dollars less than it was in 1999 what he was talking about is that the real median income of a fulltime male worker is 2100 dollars less than it was 43 years ago adjusted for inflation got that so fulltime male worker in terms of real inflationadjusted dollars earning 2100 dollars less than 43 years ago despite the fact that technology has exploded and worker productivity that workers producing more making less over the last decade eightyone percent of all us households saw flat or falling incomes over the last 15 years we have seen the closing in this country of sixty thousand factories not all of it attributable to trade automation played a role of the reasons but millions of decentpaying jobs have been lost as a result of disastrous trade agreements with large profitable multinational corporations shutdown in the United States and went abroad for cheap labor there is an issue out there that I think Trump also instinctively understood and that is the incredible level of despair which exists in many parts of this country and i said before we are asylum wise society 6700 thousand dollars here things are ok what you may not know is there are places in this country and i visited some of them i went to a community called mcdowell county in west virginia anybody to come from McDowell County southern West Virginia this is a county that used to be a coalmining of area where people have decent jobs what is going on in McDowell County what is going on in Kentucky what is going on in many parts of this country is white workingclass people today are dying at an earlier age than their parents in a historical phenomenon what life expectancy has always been about is that you live longer than your parents on average your parents live longer than their parents and so forth and so on and thats true all over the world and its true in the africanamerican community in the Latino community but in areas of this country white workingclass americans have shorter lives today than their parents and the reason that most people think that this is occurring is these are people who are working for ten eleven bucks an hour if they are lucky lucky enough to get jobs their kids in many ways are going nowhere in a hurry and they are turning to alcohol theyre turning to opiates and heroin and they are turning to suicide so there are parts of this country where the spare is so great the world has left these people behind they are not part of their communities theyre not offering anything not being paid anything and their futures look very bleak and that type of despair is also what Trump put his finger on now to my mind I have very little hope the Trump will keep the promises that he made to those people already seeing terms of the appointments with the nominations that hes making two important cabinet positions people who stand for exactly the opposite of what he campaigned not he said we gotta stop Wall Street you know the power of Wall Street criticize Hillary Clinton for ties to Wall Street well guess what does a surprise of nobody he just a point denominated as Treasury secretary somebody deep in the heart of wall street Trump said hey Im the only Republican candidate im not going to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid and he nominated somebody to become head of the Health and Human Services whose main mission in life has been to privatize or cut medicare and on and on it goes so we are going to expose the hypocrisy of mr Trump just had a trade situation recently Applause you know you campaigned a whole lot about trade and outsourcing and yet he just reached an agreement with Carrie he said to the American people that he was going to impose these really very large terrace you shut down a factory in America you got a little mexico man youre gonna pay a hell of a lot to bring their product back into the United States well sits down with the United Technologies people who own carrier and he said here im going to be really tough on you guys okay you can let half of the workers out on the street you can fire half of them were going to go to Mexico but for the other half were gonna give you a seven million dollar tax break thats how tough he was on united technologies a corporation made seven billion dollars in profit last year they dont need any more tax breaks from the American people and when we talk about what goes on in America and I have the stuff in the book but you should appreciate this and that is if you live in fairfax county virginia a wealthy community if you are a man you have a life expectancy of 82 years if youre a woman you live until youre 85 thats equivalent to what they do in Scandinavia in McDowell County the average life expectancy for a man today is 64 years of age for a woman 73 years of age hes a community six hours apart by automobile our job is to not only expose the hypocrisy of Donald Trump but it is to revitalize and bring fundamental reforms to the democratic party Applause the Democratic Party has got to open its doors to working people the young people to lowincome people I appreciate very much the time and the money that many upperincome liberals have contributed to the Democratic Party I appreciate that but the truth of the matter is the Democratic Party will not succeed by being the party of the liberal elite it has got to be the party of the working people of this country Applause so I see our mission now as we go forward and I mean we all of us in reforming the Democratic Party two major goals number one become an even more diverse party bring more women into the party more africanamericans into the party more Latinos more people from the LGBT community more Native Americans by asian americans we have to do that but second of all what we also have to do is create a party where all of us white black and Latino are very clear that in fact we will have the guts to take on Wall Street and the insurance companies and the drug companies and the fossil fuel industry and corporate america and right now i am working hard and I need your help on these things that place we talk about transforming the Democratic Party to make any grassroots body your voices have got to be part of that process are some of you may know of a congressman from Minnesota named keith Ellison and keith is already getting beaten up by the establishment are I think he would make an excellent share of the Democratic National Committee and I think what keeps mission would be is to recreate the democratic party into a party where we dont spend all of our time just raising money from the wealthy but we spend our time bringing working people and lowincome people and people of color together to fight for a nation and a government that works for all of us and not just the one percent Applause I think the most important task of the New Democratic Party is to think big and not small to go well beyond what the media and most politicians define as our options Im gonna be going back to Washington next week and the choices that are things so how much more we spend on defense how much do we cut medicaid how much do we cut Medicare how much more do we giving tax breaks to billionaires those are not the rational choices that we should be making the issues that we should be discussing all why are we the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a right Applause why do we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs so that one out of five Americans who gets a prescription from a doctor is unable to afford to fill that prescription how do we take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry let me congratulate the people of California youve done something very important I think many of you are familiar with proposition 61 and this is what you did and this is no small thing the pharmaceutical industry made the top five companies last year made 50 billion dollars in profits they have hundreds and hundreds of lobbyists in Washington and its state capitals all over this country in this one proposition whether or not prescription drug costs would be lowered here in California the pharmaceutical industry and this is just unbelievable to me spent a hundred and thirtyone billion billion billion hundred thirty 1 million dollars that the feet that property vision and yet we got fortyeight percent of the vote but those are the questions why are we the nation with so much income and wealth inequality why are homeless veterans sleeping out on the street when there are those who want to give tax breaks to billionaires why do women make seventynine cents on the dollar what all we doing to combat climate change so our job is to create a democratic party which thinks big not small which has a vision of where this the wealthiest country in the history of the world can go when we stand together and I think when we bring forth that vision and when we explained to working people and involve them in the process that yes we will take on Wall Street and the other powerful powerful corporate interests I think we can not only win politically but I believe we can transform this country into a nation that you and I know that we can become we can be the leaders in this world in so many ways think about a nation in which millions of people here are leading the world helping to lead the world transforming our energy system a new transportation system new weatherization new sustainable energies new innovations to lead the world to protect this plan to think about the kind of effort that we can mount to provide quality health care is a right every man woman and child think about a pharmaceutical industry which is not making billions in profit but is providing the new drugs that we need to conquer cancer and diabetes and Alzheimers disease the potential that we have as a nation when we bring people together is just unbelievable and that is our job our job is to understand that today as we sit here in berk there are people hurting and very hurting badly all over this country and we will not turn our backs on those people so I know that I know that as a result of the election there are a lot of people who are frightens who are in despair but i will tell you this if you study the history of our country despair is not an option it is not an option not just for you but for your children and your grandchildren and for the future of this planet if theres a lesson that must be learned from Trumps victory is that we must increase our political engagement we must be involved in all kinds of creative ways in creative ways to bring forth a progressive agenda and to stop Trumps very bad idea so thats where we are right now not a time for the spell a time to remember the struggles that those who went before us engaged in against overwhelming odds and to remember that today we are involved in a struggle but when we stand together when we act intelligently we can be victorious thank you all very much Applause Music good and now thank you doctor thank you ok I think thanks for all that you are now were going to do some I think some of you have written out some questions and jon is gonna throw them at marion and john im john from diesel bookstore thank you so much senator Sanders we have a few questions that we gathered at the beginning that people dropped off out front and one is by an inspired student as hes described himself or she describes herself after the primaries and now the general election many people here in Berkeley went through a mourning period can can you speak about the processes you went through and how we can bounce back into action like you have it is appropriate when you lose to take a day or two off let me repeat in in all seriousness when you deal with issues like bigotry and the incredible hurt that bigotry does to people when you deal with issues like climate change and understand that if we do not act very very aggressively today the kind of planet we leave our kids Ive got four kids and seven beautiful grandchildren you have kids and grandchildren that the planet that we leave those kids will be a much less healthy and habitable planet than the one that we have you dont have an option of living in rapport Morse or sadness the only option that you will have the only to mine rational sensible option that you have is to figure out how we can be most effective in fighting back and by the way thats not just rhetoric here is a truth it is as old as America and that is real change never takes place from the top on down i always get annoyed because like Bernie Bernie Bernie it is not a about Bernie boy i got it i want to break the bad news to I dont have all the answers it is about us big time you and me and him and her it is about all of us coming together when people come together we become a power that cannot be resisted that is just a fact so when millions of people you know Trump may believe whatever he believes about climate change but when millions of people when states like California New York State say no sorry that aint gonna happen and our job is to figure out how we can go forward most effectively what are the tactics and well all working on it were all thinking about that but I would say that you dont have the time to mourn you dont have the time to you no wonder why now is the time and the whole world depends upon us our effectiveness in fighting back thats the message of today Ive got a question over here this comes to you from a 13 year old student here who is admitting to playing hooky today to see you with her mother i will write you a note 13 year old and the question is in light of all the fake news its been circulating wed like to know what are your sources for news Applause this fake news stuff is a very serious issue and many millions of people have read during the campaign stuff that was total lies im gonna figure out how we deal with that at the same time were not stepping on 1st Amendment issues but the more important issue is how we do a much better job in raising political consciousness in this country and how we do a better job in educating the American people about the reality of whats going on today in the book which I guess many of you but go to let you know if you get bored in the middle skip to the last chapter its entirely corporate media a threat to our democracy ok and what and the essence of what that chapter is about is that for a variety of reasons starting off with the fact that corporate America is owned by large multinational corporations whose job is not to propagate truth or to educate but to make as much money as they possibly can thats a fact and the other factors that you got about six major conglomerates time warner a news corp CBS you got a handful of major media comcast is largest who control about ninety percent of the dissemination of information that we get on radio television and newspapers arm how do we deal with that and I think there are two answers number one we have got to demand that corporate media start talking about the real issues impacting the lives of the American people now Im not overly optimistic that that will happen because there are such inbred conflicts of interest for example is very when you see so much advertising on television from the fossil fuel industry or the pharmaceutical industry the truth is that theyre not terribly likely to talk much about why we pay the highest prices in the world for men listen or the dangers of climate change theyre just not going to do that when so much money comes in from these industries but we do our best and thats an area where citizens can become heavily involved you can demand you can demand that they start talking about why the middle class in this country isnt the client in the book it talks about something and I dont mean to be breaking here because its certainly not the case they talk about somebody did a study and they said it turns out that i think it was the sunday morning news shows which are very important that most of the discussion of poverty during the campaign a significant percentage of discussion on Sunday morning shows came from Bernie Santas now how does it happen when 43 million people are living in poverty that most of the discussion on that issue comes from one candidate where is the media talking about the suffering of millions of people today how come other people are not talking about that issue alright so we have got to demand and in another study pointed out that over ninety percent of media coverage in the campaign did not deal with issues but deal with personalities that with emails or peoples attitude toward women whatever not to say that those arent important but when an average person whos working 50 or 60 hours a week cant afford to send us get to college or a single mom cant afford childcare she would like some discussion of the issues relevant to her life but you can watch television for decades and not see that all right but the second thing is and the internet opens up this opportunity is how do we communicate effectively with millions and millions of people how do we talk about the role of money in politics so i think that is an area that we also have got to focus on is how we make sure that the internet works as a means not fake news but to get good information out the people who today are simply there are states out there where all you hear is rush limbaugh sean hannity okay in fact another issue that we have got to be dealing with is how does it happen and then in this country which is split politically over ninety percent of talk radio is extreme rightwing does that happen how does that happen in cities in America with the Republicans get twentyfive percent of the boat you cant find a progressive radio talk show so when we talk about getting involved in the political process figure out a way that you can demand corporate media to talk about the real issues that you can demand that radio stations in your community sought allowing progressive voices to be heard figure out a way that we better use the internet to get ideas out the people who have not been exposed to those ideas a lot of work to be done in that regard both you and Trump are seen as outsiders and thats why a lot of people gravitated to you both what are the chances of having a true thirdparty thats good question you know oh you are looking at the longestserving independent in the history of the United States Congress ok so you know I have some familiarity with this issue when i was elected mayor of Burlington i defeated Democratic incumbent are and over the years who run for Congress against Democrats Republicans running for mayor against democrats and republicans i know a little bit about the issue are you know in vermont in fact we now have a pretty strong progressive party are which just elected by the way a lieutenant governor lieutenant governor of the state of Vermont will be the most progressive lieutenant governor I believe in the united states of america ok so we have three people in the state Senate out of 30 so in Vermont we have made some progress and I think you know politics is an art not a science and I think you gotta look at the situation that you are in right now the choice that I have made is that I will do everything that I can i have recently been made a part of the Democratic leadership so and the responsibility that I have been given is outreach and my job and I need help on this let me take us nobody knows how to do this certainly it has not been done how do you create a broadbase diverse political party how do we create a mechanism by which the chair i would say ninetyeight percent of the american people have no clue the chairs their state chair of the democratic or republican party how do we create a vibrant party where people are feeling good are actively involved of talking about the issues are demanding their elected officials get involved in those issues nobody knows how to do that its never happened Im trying to do and Id love to have your ideas in your help but the end of the day is if we can bring millions and millions of people in there and say you know what this is my party and we are going to fight for working families were going to fight to create much better educational opportunities were taken on climate change were going to go for a medicareforall singlepayer program if we bring people into the party we can transform America and I need your help to do that so get involved get involved locally get involved in the statewide level thats where I am focusing right now so what are the chances we can get rid of the electoral college anytime soon ok good question these are really great questions of I dont know what the chances are but lets just look at the facts to important considerations number one Hillary Clinton ended up with over two million more votes than Donald Trump Donald Trump is going to be inaugurated something is not right in that picture right we all grew up believing that majority wins the person who gets the most votes wins in this case Clinton got the most votes but shes not going to be inaugurated that on the surface seems to be unacceptable secondary and maybe I speak just as somebody gets involved you know it works hard in politics and in California you will appreciate this of the way the nature of the electoral college right now is everybody knows that the state of California is a strongly democratic state state of Vermont is strongly democratic state the state of Wyoming is a strongly Republican state mississippi is a republican state so what ends up happening is when candidates run for president they focus on 17 or 18 battleground states they spent a lot of time in michigan and ohio and florida dont spend a lot of time in California or Vermont for that matter or Wyoming so the needs of the people of those states really dont get paid a whole lot of attention to so to answer your question I think we need a serious discussion about how we address that issue clearly the status quo is not working is wrong how do we get people to understand that theyre voting against their best interests and what cannot i do to help the disenfranchised to realize they can make a difference i think if again I think this issue comes back to the weakness of the Democratic Party if the Democratic Party had in fact raise the minimum wage to a living wage if the Democratic Party had provided and passed legislation for healthcare were all if the Democratic Party had in fact past pay equity for women if the Democratic Party had put many billions of dollars into rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and creating millions of jobs at the Democratic Party had led the effort in terms of criminal justice reform or in terms of immigration reform people would know which party was fighting for them but the truth is the Democratic Party has not done that they do better than the Republican Party to be sure but it is not good and offering major political party to say vote for me because these guys are much worse than I am that is not an agenda that you can run on so you know what i think is that and where my mind is right now and again we are just got this assignment that we could to again were trying to figure out how best to do it arm not because it has never really be done before how do you create a real with a small D democratic party where the ideas in needs of people filter on up to the elected officials and where the elected officials are held accountable by the people all right alright so were working on that and we need your help sometime and maybe thats all saying that one yeah Im getting dizzy whos gonna heart where I got a million of them all right are you worried that any bipartisan in quotes cooperation with Trump will lend legitimacy to his politics of hate thats a very good question and as I indicated i mean the way i see it them and people can disagree with me the way i see it is and i just i started my remarks off by saying but noooo that can be no compromise on bigotry there can be no compromise on climate change that can be no credit compromise on protecting American democracy but if Trump comes up Trump campaigns are on the need to rebuild our infrastructure well our infrastructure is crumbling now the proposal that he seems he doesnt come up with a defined planet seems to be a pretty dumb when its giving tax breaks to large corporations and privatizing the infrastructure something you might expect from rightwing Republicans but if in fact a compromise can be worked out in which in fact we have a decent plan to rebuild our infrastructure and create millions of jobs yeah I think that is something that we can work with them on i think that in terms of trade policy you know it turns out that hes backing away from what he said but by the way I dont know everybody may not agree but one of the victories that the progressive movement has made in the last year is the defeat of the transpacific partnership the TPP so how do we and this is something that Trump talked about a lot how do we create a trade policy in which corporate America reinvests in this country creates decentpaying jobs in this country how do we rebuild our manufacturing base how do we make sure that when people lose their jobs because of automation or whatever theyre not simply thrown out on the street and Trump talked about new trade policies if he comes up with something thats halfway decent now hes already back to offer them but again we will hold him accountable and if you can come up with something that makes sense yeah i think we should work with but i think on the basic fundamental issues of bigotry of climate change of democracy no there cannot be any compromise Applause this is the last question sorry automation caused unemployment seems more of an issue than TP what do you think should be done to make it possible to learn a living that is a basic income good arm I mean these are exactly the kinds of questions which need discussion which get virtually no discussion at all and this requires us to think big and not small technology should be a positive there is nothing wonderful about working in a factory 50 or 60 hours a week nothing great about it but it is better than being unemployed so the question is how does it happen that with an explosion of technology and an increase in working pretty worker productivity so many working people have lost their jobs so the answer really answer your question speaks to about creating a very different type of America an America that starts off with the premise that every one of our people men women and children in the wealthiest country in the history of the world will have a decent standard of living and have some robot comes along to take your job we should see that as a positive thing not a negative thing if youre working 30 hours a week rather than 60 hours a week thats a good thing not a bad thing but you need the income to take care of your family inch we cannot continue to live in a society where technology and greed rule hey sorry got a new machine you lose your job youre out on the street no we got a new job new machine you have to work less hours but of course you could continue to get the income you need to take care of your family Music I mean but that really does require a political revolution when I talk in the book and i talked about you know every day about a political revolution what it means is there is no define revolution you all the revolutionaries it means the questions like that are exactly the difficult questions not easy stuff that we have got to tackle but i think it gets back to something that FDR franklin delano roosevelt talked about which got no attention at all actually Michael Moore picked up honor of you any of you saw that Michael put it in underwear was one of his last film something he had a film of FDR talking about a second bill of rights any of you familiar with that alright and what the second bill of rights was about is not just the first bill rights is protecting our freedom of religion freedom of speech all thats the good stuff the second bill of rights talks about economic rights it says that people in a democratic civilized society are entitled as a right to have a job it talks about the right to healthcare the right to good education now the difference between us and the rightwing people is they believe in a market economy where if you have your goal is to make as much money as you possibly can and in the last 15 years weve seen a tenfold increase in billionaires and they can make as much money as they can if you have nothing to block you dont have any healthcare your old you dont have enough money to live on your baby not getting enough food thats a lot thats not their concern alright but our job i think is the fight for in fact that concept of human rights healthcare is a right a decent job is a right protecting the environment is a human right ending bigotry is a human right all right and thats what our struggle is about and these are not going to be easy you know people in this room will disagree open up i think this i think that thats right gotta learn how to work with each other but i think on all of those issues as i said at the very beginning of my remarks you will find the vast majority of the American people supporting our agenda dont forget that so weve got a lot of work to do in the weeks and months and years to come we got a lot of work to do it lets go forward together thank you all very much Thank You senator sanders thanks all of you Applause let me thank all of you for joining me tonight I know that it is late and Im not gonna go on for too long and let me also just congratulate Stacey Abrams for her very very effective response to President Trump say to the Union now we I think all know why she would have been a wonderful governor of Georgia I know that this will probably not shock you but I hate to say this but not everything Donald Trump said tonight was true or accurate tonight when we talk about the economy tonight in on numerous occasions since he has taken office President Trump has told the American people that the US economy is the hottest economy anywhere in the world that it is really booming well that may be true for the members of his mera Lago Country Club where the price of admission has doubled to 200000 for those folks who go to Trumps Club and for the wealthiest people in our nation Trump is right the economy is really booming in fact for many of president Trumps billionaire friends the truth is they have never ever had it so good but for the middle class and for the working families of our country the truth is that the economy is not so great over the last year for example real inflation accounted for wages for the average and American worker is up by all of 12 percent just nine dollars and 11 cents a week in fact real wages for that same worker that average American worker are lower today than they were in 1973 let me repeat that the average American worker after adjusting for inflation is theyre earning less today then he or she did 46 years ago despite huge increases in productivity sadly millions of American workers are now forced to work two or three jobs just to pay the bills and to keep their heads above water economically in America today and somehow or another President Trump didnt mention this in his speech we have more wealth and income inequality than almost any major country on earth and it is more unfair more unequal now than in any other time since the Gilded Age of the 1920s yes the economy is great for the three wealthiest people in America who own more wealth than the bottom half of our country a hundred and sixty million Americans yes the economy is great for the top one percent who now earn forty six percent of all new income in our economy yes the economy is great for the top 25 hedge fund managers on Wall Street who made nearly twice as much income last year as all a hundred and forty thousand kindergarten teachers in our country 25 hedge fund managers yeah the economy is great for the five richest people in America who have seen their wealth go up by over 100 billion dollars since Trump was elected and for corporations that have announced over 1 trillion dollars in stock buybacks in 2018 alone yes the economy may be great for those folks but it is absolutely not booming for the nearly 80 percent of American workers who live paycheck to paycheck desperately hoping that their child doesnt get sick praying that their call doesnt break down or that they dont lose their job despite what President Trump says this is not a hot economy when 43 of households cant afford to pay for housing food child care health care transportation and a cell phone without going into debt that is not a hot economy for ordinary Americans the economy is not booming when half of Americans 55 years of age and older have no idea how they will live out the last years of their lives with dignity because they have no retirement savings and that includes unbelievably 20 of seniors trying to survive on incomes of less than 14000 a year I just dont know how anybody certainly not a senior citizen survives on 14000 a year this is not the strongest economy we have ever had according to Trump when hundreds of thousands of young people are unable to go to college because they cant afford it and millions more are struggling without rageous levels of student debt when over 34 million Americans have no health insurance when one out of five of our people cannot afford the medicine prescribed to them by their doctors and when over 40 million people in our country are living in poverty this is not an economy we should be proud of when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the developed world and when life expectancy in the United States has actually gone down for the third year in a row and as we speak tonight let us not forget that in America millions of our people are working for starvation wages 800 an hour 9 an hour at 10 an hour and here is the simple truth nobody can raise a family or pay the rent or take care of the necessities of life on these poverty wages but you know what I didnt hear Donald Trump talk about raising the minimum wage to a living wage at least 15 bucks an hour somehow didnt talk about that tonight president Trump talked about what a great job he has done on trade but what he forgot to tell you is that the annual trade deficit has gone up by over 100 billion dollars since he became president and our trade deficit with China in Mexico has gone up by tens of billions of dollars meanwhile since Trump was elected corporations have shipped shipped a hundred and eightyfive thousand American jobs overseas President Trump also talked tonight about the need to rebuild our countrys crumbling infrastructure our roads and our bridges and our water systems and our wastewater plants and he is absolutely right it is an absolute disgrace that in the wealthiest nation on earth we have an infrastructure that is crumbling but the proposal that he is bringing forth is dead wrong it is an absurd proposal Trump would encourage States to sell our nations highways our bridges and other vital infrastructure to Wall Street to wealthy campaign contributors even to foreign governments the reality is that trumps plan to privatize our nations infrastructure is an old idea that has never worked and in fact never will work President Trump said tonight quote we are born free and we will stay free end of quote well I say the president Trump people are not truly free when they cant afford to go to the doctor when they are sick people are not truly free when they cannot afford to buy the prescription drugs they desperately need people are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity people are not truly free when they are exhausted because they are working longer and longer hours for lower wages people are not truly free when they cannot afford a decent place in which to live people certainly are not free when they cannot afford to feed their families as dr Martin Luther King jr said in 1968 and I quote this country has socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor end quote with dr King said then was true and it is true today and it remains absolutely unacceptable tonight Donald Trump who in less than two years in the White House has seen five aids either plead guilty or be convicted of criminal charges claim the strength of the economy was depended on him being free from necessary oversight and investigations into wrongdoing by both his campaign and his administration the exact opposite is true Americas strength is based on the rule of law and the fact that no one not even the president of the United States is above it tonight in terms of crime Trump talked about a terrible terrible and heinous murder in Reno Nevada committed by an undocumented immigrant who happens to be Latino in fact as I think many of you will recall over the last several years trump has talked time and time again about crimes committed by undocumented Latino immigrants his demonization of Latinos is nothing less than racist it is wrong and it also happens to be factually inaccurate undocumented Latino immigrants commit fewer crimes in the United States than the general public but I want you to think about something for a moment isnt it strange that when we talk about terrible crimes committed in the United States or in the state of Nevada Donald Trump forgot to mention that in 2017 a white man named Stefan Stephen Patek killed 58 people and wounded 851 in the deadliest shooting in modern American history that also happened in Nevada now how come Trump didnt mention that if he is concerned about crime how come Trump didnt talk about one of the worst mass murders in American history needless to say he also didnt mention the need for commonsense gun safety legislation which would lower the terrible rate of mass shootings in our country tonight Donald Trump repeated some of the most extreme antiwoman attacks coming from the far right at a time when we see an unprecedented in coordinated attack against a womans right to truce it is incredibly important that we fight to make sure that every woman in this country has the right to control her own body tonight Donald Trump correctly talked about the need to address the opioid crisis well President Trump you dont help people suffering from opioid addiction by writing a budget which calls for a trillion dollar cut to Medicaid that would be a devastation a devastating moment in the fight against opioid addiction now as important as it is to respond to what President Trump said tonight it is even more important to discuss some of what Trump refused to talk about which happens to include some of the most important issues facing our country and the entire world now how can a President of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention not one word about climate change when the leading scientists of the world tell us that climate change is real that climate change is caused by human activity and that climate change is already causing devastating harm in the United States and in much of the world further the scientists tell us that we have a very short 12 years not a lot of time in order to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy if we are going to have a planet that is healthy and habitable for our children and our grandchildren somehow or another Donald Trump just forgot to talk about that Trump also forgot to discuss the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right now how can he ignore the fact that we spend far more per capita on healthcare than any other country on earth while at the same time tens of millions of our fellow Americans are uninsured or underinsured somehow or another Trump forgot to get to that issue how can President Trump not discuss the a terrible attacks that we are seeing to undermine the fundamentals of American democracy which includes the disastrous citizens united Supreme Court decision that allows billionaires to buy elections Trump talked a lot about freedom tonight but somehow another he didnt talk about governors efforts all across this country governors who are trying to suppress the boat and make it harder for poor people or people of color to vote you cant talk about freedom in America and ignore the massive amounts of voter suppression taking place denying people the right to participate in our democracy Donald Trump talked about the economy but he forgot to mention the fact that state after state is doing the right thing and is raising the minimum wage to a living wage 15 an hour but I didnt hear President Trump say that he would work with me and with other advocates of a living wage to raise the minimum wage at the federal level to 15 bucks an hour somehow didnt get into that how could President Trump not mention the words Social Security Medicare or Medicaid in his State of the Union speech when he promised over and over again during his campaign you remember that then he would not cut these programs could it be because his budget proposed massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security in direct violation of his campaign pledge how could Trump not talk about the reality that Russia through cyber warfare interfered in our election in 2016 is interfering in democratic elections all over the world and according to the heads of his own national security agencies attempted to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections how can the president say nothing about Yemen where the humanitarian crisis in where the worst humanitarian crisis in the world is currently taking place brought on by a saudiled war that the United States is supporting and just yesterday a CNN report detailed how our Saudi and Emirati allies have been giving us made weapons to Al qaedalinked fighters in Yemen and Ive also fallen into the hands of Iranian backed Houthi rebels this war is a disaster which is why the Senate passed a resolution that I sponsored last December calling on the President to end our support for that terrible war and why colleagues in both the House and the Senate reintroduce that legislation last week this is an enormous ly important foreign policy issue it speaks to our relationship with a despotic regime in Saudi Arabia somehow Trump forgot to mention that President Trump has stated tonight and over and over and over and over again that building a wall on the Mexican border is a national emergency in fact he shut down the government and caused enormous pain and uncertainty but some 800000 federal employees who are forced to go to work but were not paid all because of his insistence on that wall no president Trump building a wall is not an emergency in terms of immigration in this country what we need to do is not to waste billions of dollars on a wall but to finally address the need the comprehensive immigration reform including a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented people it is inhumane and not what Americans America stands for that tiny children at the border have been torn are torn apart from their parents it is disgraceful that 18 million young people raised in the United States and who know no other country but the United States have lost their legal protection under the dr program because of Trumps actions it is heartbreaking that almost 11 million undocumented people living in this country the overwhelming majority of whom are hardworking and lawabiding worry every day about being deported and separated from their loved ones what a president of the United States is supposed to do and I think in a certain sense of almost all presidents in recent history have understood that is that when youre president you bring our people together whether they are black or white or Latino whether the Asian American Native American whether theyre men or women whether theyre gay or straight thats what a president is supposed to do but in an unprecedented way that is not what this president is doing in fact he is trying to divide us up he is trying to have one group turn against another group and that is certainly not what this country is supposed to be about Trump said tonight that we should quote govern not as two parties but as one nation I agree but Trumps agenda of providing tax breaks to billionaires while throwing millions of Americans off of health insurance is the exact opposite of what the American people want if Trump truly wants to govern in a bipartisan matter lets take a look at what the overwhelming majority of the American people want in other words I know this is a radical idea but I say to the President of the United States why dont you do what the American people want you to do rather than what wealthy campaign contributors won let me give you some examples a Fox News poll conducted last month shows that 70 percent of Americans support a tax increase on families making over 10 million according to Reuters 70 percent of the American people including 52 of Republicans support Medicare for all they understand that the current health system is not working and they want to join every other country on Earth in making health care a right not a privilege another poll found that 72 of the American people including 51 of Republicans want to expand Social Security benefits make sure that our elderly people can retire in dignity and do that by increasing taxes on millionaires and billionaires according to Gallup 76 percent of the American people including large majorities of Republicans and Democrats want us to spend a trillion dollars on an infrastructure plan to create up to 15 million goodpaying jobs the Kaiser Family Foundation has found that 92 percent of Americans want Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug prices 92 percent that same poll also found that 72 of Americans including threequarters of Republicans want the freedom to buy lowcost prescription drugs from Canada Gallup tells us that 64 of Americans including 51 percent of Republicans believe marijuana should be legal and that tells me that we should end the disastrous war on drugs Quinnipiac tells us that Americans support by over 94 percent requiring background checks for all gun purchases CBS has found that 87 of Americans including 79 of Republicans want to allow immigrants who are brought to the United States as children to stay in our country and according to a July 2018 survey paid for by the Koch brothers 66 percent of Americans believe quote government paid college tuition is an effective solution to social barriers sixtyfive percent of Americans believe that a fifteen dollar minimum wage is an effective solution to low wages 69 percent of Americans believe that we need more regulation of Wall Street and 69 of Americans also believe we should be increasing government assistance for child care my fellow Americans if the overwhelming majority of Americans want us to pass these enormous enormous leap popular initiatives why cant Congress pass them why isnt Congress and the White House doing what the American people want them to do and the answer frankly is not complicated the answer has everything to do with the power of the moneyed interests Wall Street big drug companies huge health insurance companies the fossil fuel industry multinational corporations in the billionaire class all of these groups are spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to get Congress to do their bidding but while they may have the money and God Only Knows they have an endless supply of money we have something that is more powerful on our side and that is that we have the people they have the money we have the people if we are serious about transforming our country if we are serious about rebuilding the shrinking middle class if we are serious about reinvigorating our democracy and increasing voter turnout and bringing young people into the political process let us bring our people together to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation the billionaire class must learn that they cannot have it all our government belongs to each and every one of us not just the few together let us fight for economic social racial and environmental justice let us end unbridled greed let us create the kind of America that we know we can become thank you all and have a great night thank you thank you thank you you know we have had we have had large turnouts in Wisconsin in Colorado this is the largest turnout thank you there are a lot of people here a lot of people and you know when we were coming to Arizona somebody said Arizona is a conservative state what were they talking about somebody told me that people are given up on the political process not what I see you tonight thank you all so much I cannot believe this crowd and I just wanna thank you so much for coming out presents your incredible presence here tonight gives me hope and gives people all over this country hope that when we stand together when we come together in meetings like this there is nothing that we cannot accomplish in transforming America and I want to thank you Lando for that wonderful introduction shes a member of the CWA and I thank the CWA and the trade union movement in this country what this campaign is about is pretty simple what this campaign is about is saying that our great country and our government belong to all of the people and not a handful a billionaires what I want to do tonight is to do something that we too rarely do and that is just lay on the table the important issues facing our country and determine how we can go forward so that government represents all of us and addresses the serious problems that we face and the first issue the first issue that I want to put on the table is the issue of income and wealth inequality today we live in a nation which has more income and more wealth inequality than any other major country on earth that is not acceptable and together we are going to change that if you think about it for a moment you recognize that the issue of income and wealth inequality is a moral issue all week intense and I didnt even finish the sentence all we consent to seeing a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth it is a moral issue but it is an economic issue as well because our economy cannot do well when so few have so much and so many have so little my Republican friends think that the CEOs of large corporations are the job creators you know do you know who the job creators huh you are the job creators and when working people have money in their pocket they go out and they buy goods and they buy services and when they do that they create jobs but when millions of people have nothing to spend we are not creating the jobs that we need and that is why I believe that what our economics should be about is putting money into the hands of working people and not the billionaires brothers and sisters there is something profoundly wrong when the top onetenth of 1 own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 there is something profoundly wrong when in the last several years 58 percent of all new income created has gone to the top one percent there is something profoundly wrong when one family one family the owners of Walmart own more wealth than the bottom forty percent of the American people this grotesque level of income and wealth inequality is bad economics it is unsustainable and it is not what the United States of America is supposed to be about and we have a message tonight to the billionaire class and that message is you cannot have it all you cannot get huge tax breaks when children in Vermont and Arizona go hungry you cannot continued to ship out jobs to China when millions of Americans need work here you cannot hide your profits your billions and profits of the Cayman Islands and other tax havens when we have unmet needs in America that must be addressed and what we are saying to the billionaire class is their greed has got turned and we are going to end it for them what it is not just the grotesque an embarrassing level of income and wealth inequality when we talk about whats going on in America today we have got to recognize the tragic reality that for the last 40 years not 10 years not 20 but for the last 40 years the great middle class of this country once the envy of the entire world that middle class has been disappearing and I want you to think about this all of you know that we have seen in recent years an explosion of Technology and worker productivity and yet despite that median family income today is almost five thousand dollars less than it was in 1999 all over America all over America all over our great country people are working not just one job not just two jobs theyre working three jobs for jobs to cobble together some income and some health care this economy can do and must do better than that and let me say a word about unemployment once a month you read the official unemployment results coming from the government and they tell you that official unemployment is 53 percent but what they dont tell you is if you look in another government statistic which includes those people have given up looking for work and those people who are working parttime you know anybody working parttime when they want to work fulltime when you add all of that together real unemployment is 105 and let me tell you something else that we almost never discuss and that is the tragedy of youth unemployment in this country a recent study came out recent study came out looking at kids who graduated high school and this is what it said if those kids were white their real unemployment rate was 33 percent if they were Hispanic their unemployment rate was 36 percent if they were africanamerican their unemployment rate was 51 percent and let me tell you something else in America today we have more people in jail than any other country on earth thats right and one of the reasons aside from a broken criminal justice system one of the reasons that we have so many people in jail is that we have five and a half million kids hanging out on street corners with no jobs and no education and it seems to me to make a lot more sense to invest in education and jobs for our kids rather than in jail and incarceration I want our country to have the best educated people more people going to college than any other country not more people in jail than any other country and when we talk about the economy its not just income and wealth inequality its not just high unemployment it is low low wages all over our country in my state in your state youve got people working 40 50 hours a week not earning the money they need to feed their families or put a few bucks in the bank in Washington the federal minimum wage is 725 an hour brothers and sisters 725 is a starvation wage we have got to we have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage 15 bucks an hour I dont think it is a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week that person should not be living in poverty thats what America should be and when we talk about fair wages we also have to understand that it is unacceptable that women today make 78 cents on the dollar compared to men brothers we have got to stand with our sisters and fight for pay equity for women workers now as many of you know a lot of my Republican colleagues you know what they stand for well let me tell you what they stand for some of what they stand for what our Republican colleagues talk about our Family Values you ever hear them talk about Family Values and this is what they mean by Family Values they mean that a woman should not be able and have the right to control her own body I disagree they believe that women if you can believe this should not be able to purchase the contraceptives they want and they believe that our gay brothers and sisters should not have the right to marry those are their family values those are not our family values but let me tell you what I think Family Values should be real family values that support families that enable love to exist and care to exist in families first we have got to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth which does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave today in Arizona today in Vermont a woman is giving birth if that woman has ample income she will be able to stay home and the father will be able to stay home with that baby to get to bond with that baby to get to love that baby to get to know that baby and perhaps one of the most important moments in a familys life but if that woman does not have adequate income she will be forced to go back to work in three days five days seven days that is not a family value that is that is exactly the opposite of what a family value is that is why I will fight for and bring about 12 weeks of paid family and medical aid all over this country thats right all over this country we have working people who when they get sick they go to work and they go to work because they have no guaranteed sick time its time to end that and provide guaranteed paid sick time for every worker in America you know I think we all heard a few weeks ago that Jeb Bush thinks that the American people Jeb Bush thinks the American people need to work a little bit harder well he obviously didnt heal the sad reality that the American people already work the longest hours of any major country on earth our people do not need to work longer hours they need higher wages and better income now when we talk about the crises facing our country when pollsters ask people whats on your mind what do you think is most important what people invariably say is jobs we need more jobs well in my view when we have over 30 youth unemployment ten and a half percent unemployment in general when our infrastructure our roads bridges water systems rail are crumbling we can and should put millions of people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure I have introduced legislation that would put a trillion dollars into our roads and bridges which would create up to 13 million jobs and that is exactly what we have to do think of in America where all over this country our people are rebuilding our slippers now fall behind many other countries lets have the best rail system in the world thats what Ill be able to work doing that and when we talk about creating jobs we also have to talk about stopping the loss of jobs because of our disastrous trade policies you are looking at a senator who voted against NAFTA against CAFTA against permanent normal trade relations with China and is leading the opposition to this disastrous trade TPP trade again we need trade policies which create jobs in America we need corporate America to start investing in America and not just countries all over the world now when we talk when we talk about whats going on in this country but we talk about greed when we talk about recklessness when we talk about illegal behavior these are just some of the words that we use to describe Wall Street today the largest six financial institutions in this country have assets of some 10 trillion dollars equivalent to 60 of the GDP of America after we bailed them out because they were too big to fail most of them are now a lot bigger than they were before we bail them out in my view if a financial institution is too big to fail it is too big to exist and that is why I have introduced legislation to break these huge financial institutions up now I want to talk very briefly about an issue which in many ways may be more important than any other and that is that as a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case the American political system has been totally corrupted and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined what the Supreme Court said to the wealthiest people in our country they said ok guys you already own much of the economy were now going to give you the opportunity to own the United States government and that is what they are trying to do in this campaign the Koch brothers alone the second wealthiest family in America will be spending almost a billion dollars in this campaign cycle that is more money than either the democratic or republican parties are spending when one family spends more money than either of the two major political parties that is not democracy that is oligarchy and that is why we have got to overturn Citizens United and why we need public funding of elections I want I see a lot of young people here today and I want our young people to be able to run for office if they want to and not have to beg money from the rich and the powerful to do that and now that we have a lot of young people here let me mention another issue of importance to our youth right now all of you know that we live as a nation in a highly competitive global economy and if we are going to succeed into the future we need the best educated workforce in the world at this moment if you can believe it this is how crazy it is there are hundreds of thousands of bright hardworking qualified young people who are unable to get a college education not because they dont have the ability but because their family doesnt have the money so think for a moment what it means to some kid some lowincome kids some workingclass kid who wants to make it into the middle class but cant go to college because his family lacks the funds thats wrong and that is why I have introduced legislation and will fight for his president to make every public college and university in America tuition free and I want you I want you to think for a moment I want you to think for a moment what free public college and free public university will mean what it will mean what it will mean is not only helping kids with seniors or juniors at high school what it will tell kids in the fourth grade in the sixth grade here in Phoenix or in Burlington Vermont that no matter how poor you may be if you study hard you do well in school you can in fact get all the education you need and the other higher education the other higher education issue that we have got to deal with is the absurdity of millions of Americans some young and some not so young who are carrying outrageous student debt I mean Im talking not just 50000 not a hundred thousand I talk to a young woman graduated dental school four hundred thousand dollars in debt what my legislation would do is end the absurdity of people with student debt paying eight nine ten percent interest rates if you can refinance your home at to a 3 you shouldnt be paying 10 while your student debt and we have also got to get the US government out of the business of profiteering on student debt there is another issue that is of such great importance that Pope Francis in a recent encyclical focus on it and by the way god bless Pope Francis he has you know I think sometimes people think my economic views are radical you should hear what this guy is saying when he talks about money being a god of modern civilization people worshipping money rather than their brothers and their sisters but what he wrote about in his recent encyclical is what virtually the entire scientific community is telling us and that is that we have a moral obligation as adults and parents to leave this planet to our kids and grandchildren in a habitable way climate change is real climate change is caused by human activity climate change is already causing devastating problems in our country and all over the world we must lead the world in an extremely aggressive way in breaking our dependence on fossil fuels in mood and in moving to wind solar geothermal and other sustainable energies and here is what the scientists tell us they say if we do not do that by the end of this century this planet will be between five and ten degrees Fahrenheit warmer and what that will mean is more droughts more flooding more extreme weather disturbances more acidification of the ocean more more international conflict as countries fight force kasih natural resources we have the moral obligation to lead the world in transforming our energy system and when we talk about rights and when we talk about how the United States and many respects lags behind other countries there is no issue in which that is clearer than the issue of healthcare today the United States of America is the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all people as a right and together you and I are going to end that embarrassment because we are going to pass a medicareforall singlepayer program we can do it we can do it healthcare must be seen as a right not a privilege what we have also got to do as we transform America is to understand a very simple point and I am the only candidate for president who will tell you this but it is the truth and that is no president none no matter how good he or she may be can bring about the changes that we need desperately need in this country unless there is a political revolution and what that political revolution means is that people all over America have got to stand up and become involved in the political process in a way we have never done before we have got to also as part of that revolution have real debate on real issues which is what Im trying to do tonight I want you to do me a favor I want you to talk go out of your zone of comfort I want you to talk to your Republican friends and family members now heres the point heres the boy heres the boy it is one thing for the billionaire class to be voting Republican but there are many Republicans out there you know them these people are working at two or three jobs they have no health care their kids cant afford to go to college and yet theyre voting against people who are fighting against their best interests every single day ask your Republican friends why they vote for folks who want tax breaks for billionaires and yet they want to cut Social Security and Medicare ask them why theyre voting for people who are going to throw them out onto the street shut down their factories and move their plants abroad so what we need to do is to create a political movement a political movement which brings our people together what Republicans what Republicans are very good at is not talking about what they really believe you have never seen an ad on TV which says vote for me so I could cut your Social Security and give a tax break to billionaires but that is exactly what they are trying to do now how do they get away with this stuff I will tell you how they divide us up by race by country of origin by sexual orientation by gender they say they say to Whites worried about blacks they say to nativeborn Americans worried about immigrants they say to men worry about women our job is not to divide our job is to bring people together and when we talk about bringing one nation together we have got to understand that today in America there are 11 million people living in the shadows people who are afraid that they could be deported tomorrow that is wrong we need comprehensive immigration reform we need a path towards citizenship for undocumented people we need not to be dividing families we need to be uniting families and keeping them together now in our country there is a lot that we should be proud of we have made significant progress in recent years in breaking down many barriers of discrimination if we were sitting here or in your case standing here 30 years ago and somebody said you know I have a crazy idea I think that maybe in 2008 the United States will have overcome its racist history and elect an africanamerican to be President people would have said thats crazy that wont happen it happened because we overcame a lot of racism but let us be very clear while we have overcome a lot of racism we have come a long way we still have a long way to go it is not acceptable to me and I know to you that an africanamerican baby a male baby born today if we do not change things stands a oneinfour chance of being in prison during his life it is not acceptable to me that we have seen young black men walk down streets in this country be beaten and be killed unjustly that is not acceptable most police officers I was a mayor I was a mayor for eight years and I worked with the police law but its a tough job both cops do it well but when a police officer breaks the law that officer must be held accountable what I let me let me conclude by saying this I want you all to think big not think small I want you to all appreciate that you are living in the wealthiest country today in the history of the world the wealthiest country but nobody knows it because all of the wealth rests in the hands of the few so what we need to do is to have a vision which says that wealth and income become spread out in a way that is fair what we need to do is to have a vision that says that every person in this country is entitled to healthcare as a right that when a mom or a dad goes to work he or she knows that their kid in a trial care center or prek will get the best quality care available I am the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee and I will tell you that in this country we have a moral obligation to make sure that every veteran every man and woman who put their lives on the line to defend this country gets the health care and the benefits they do we are not going to defend were not gonna turn our backs on our veterans we are going to be a nation and we are going to create a nation where everyone no matter their race their religion their disability or their sexual orientation realizes the full potential of equality that is the birthright of Americans I several years ago I attended a meeting in northern Vermont which was honoring veterans who fought in World War two and at the beginning of that meeting somebody played a tape a videotape looking at Franklin Delano Roosevelt on December 8th 1941 and that was the day after Pearl Harbor and what Roosevelt was doing that day was declaring war against Japan and so do you declare war against Hitler in Germany on that day the United States was unprepared to fight one war let alone two was but in two and a half years because this country focused on creating the best military in the world producing the tanks and the planes and the guns we did we won that war in two and a half years so I dont want anybody to tell me that this country when we put our minds to it cannot guarantee health care to all dont tell me we cant lead the world in combating climate change or have the best infrastructure in the world dont tell me dont tell me because I dont believe it that we cant create a system where all of our kids get a great education but none of this comes easy Frederick Douglas the great abolitionist told us that freedom does not come without struggle I need you because this is not about me its about us we need to stand together to make that political revolution where we create an America and a government that works for all of us we can do it when we stand up we can do it when we stand up and say enough is enough the billionaires are not gonna have it all its our country lets create that nation thank you all very much
