 Im Joey Logan I am president of NIHs the French Space Agency and the presidentelect of the International Astronautical Federation and it is my pleasure to welcome you here at the 67 International Astronautical Congress Elon Musk is founder CEO and lead designer of SpaceX alone from with SpaceX in 2002 with the goal of revolution in space technology and ultimately enabling humans to become a multiplanetary species and that the plan is going to lay out for us today SpaceX has a number of firsts including as the first private company to deliver cargo to and from the International Space Station and the first entity to land an orbital glass monster back on land and not on ships out at sea please join me in welcoming Elon Musk Applause all right thank you thank you very much for having me and look forward to talking about the spacex mars architecture and what i really want to try to achieve here is to make mars seem possible make it seem as though its something that we can do in our lifetimes and that you can go and and is there really a way that that anyone can go if they wanted to I think thats thats really the important thing so I mean first of all why go anywhere right the I think theres a really two fundamental paths history is going to bifurcate along two directions one one path is we say on earth forever and then there will be some eventual extinction event I dont have an immediate doomsday prophecy but theres its eventually history suggests there will be some some doomsday event what the alternative is to become a spacefaring civilization and a multiplanet species which I hope you would agree that is the right way to go yes thats what we want yeah so how do we figure out how to take you to Mars and cant create a selfsustaining city a city that it is not really an outpost but could become a planet in its own right and for us thus we could become a truly multiplanet species there you know but sometimes we wonder well what about other places in the solar system why why Mars well just to sort of put things in perspective this is this is what this is an actual scale of what the solar system looks like so were currently in the third little rock from the left thats earth exactly the and our goal is to go to the fourth rock on the left thats Mars but you get a sense for the real scale in the solar system how big the Sun is of Jupiter Neptune at your Saturn Uranus and then the little guys in on the right or Pluto and Friends this sort of helps see it not quite to scale but it gives you a better sense for where things are so our options for were going to focal plant species within our solar system are unlimited we have in terms of nearby options weve got Venus but Venus is a high pressure and superhigh pressure a hot acid bath so that that would be a tricky one Venus is not at all like the goddess this is not in no way similar to to to the actual goddess so it really difficult to make things work on Venus a mercury is also way too close to the Sun we could go potentially on the more than on the the moons of Jupiter or Saturn but those are quite far out much further from the Sun a lot harder to get to it really leaves us with one option if we want to become a multi planet civilization and thats thats Mars we could conceivably go to our moon and I may have running against going to the moon but I think its its challenging to create a become multi planet or in the moon because its its much smaller than than thinner planet it doesnt have any atmosphere its not as resource rich as Mars its got a 28 day day whereas the Mars days 24 and a half hours and in general Mars is far better suited to ultimately scale up to be a selfsustaining civilization just to give some comparison between the the two planets that theyre actually felt theyre remarkably close in a lot of ways and in fact we not believe that that early Mars was a lot like Earth and in fact if we could warm ours up we would once again have a thick thick atmosphere and liquid oceans so but way things are right now Marthas Mars is about half again as far from the Sun as as Earth so its still decent sunlight its a little cold but we can warm it up it has a very helpful atmosphere which in the case of Mars being primarily co2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other trace elements means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere and so and it has nitrogen tea which is also very important for growing plants it would quite fun to be on Mars because youd have gravity which is about 36 35  out of Earth so you be able to lift heavy things and bound around and like a lot of fun and that the day is remarkably close to that of and so we just need to change that bottom row because currently we have 7 billion people on earth and zero on Mars so theres been a lot of great work by NASA and other organizations in early exploration of Mars and understanding that what Mars is like where could we land whats the composition of the the atmosphere where where is their water order ice I should say and and so we need to go from these early exploration missions to actually building a city the issue that we have today is that if you look at a Venn diagram we the theres theres no intersection of sets of people who want to go and can afford to go in fact right now you cannot go to Mars for infinite money using traditional methods you know if taking certain apollo style approach the an optimistic cost number would be about 10 billion dollars a person so for example the apollo program it the costs estimates are somewhere between 100 to 200 billion dollars in current current year dollars and we sent 12 people to the services moon which was an incredible thing and I think probably the one of the greatest achievements of humanity but but thats better this deep price to pay for a ticket thats why these circles only just barely touch so you cant create a selfsustaining civilization if the ticket price is 10 billion dollars a person what we need is a closer is to move those circles together and if we get a cut the cost of moving to Mars to be roughly equivalent to a median house price in in the US which is around 200000 then I think the probability of establishing a selfsustaining civilization is very high I think I think it would almost certainly occur not not everyone would want to go and getting a relatively small number of people from earth would want to go but enough would want to go and who could afford the trip that it would happen are you people get sponsorship and and I think it gets the point where were almost anyone if they saved up and this was their goal they could ultimately save enough money to to buy a ticket and move to Mars and Mars would have labor shortage for a long time so a jobs were not being short supply so it is a bit tricky because we have to figure out how to improve the cost of trips to Mars by five million percent so this is just not easy and I mean its and it sounds like virtually impossible but I think I think there ways to do it this is this translates to an improvement of approximately four and a half orders of magnitude there these are the key elements that are needed in order to achieve the four and a half order of magnitude improvement most of the improvement would come from full reusability somewhere between two and two and a half orders of magnitude and then the other two orders magnitude would come from refilling in orbit propelled production on Mars and choosing the right propellant so Im going to go into detail on all those full reusability is really the the super hard one its very difficult to achieve reusability for for even an orbital system and that challenge becomes even your substantially greater for a system that has to go to another planet but as an example of the difference between reusability and expandability in aircraft and this you could actually use any form of transport you could say a car bicycle horse if they were singleuse almost no one reduced them itd be too expensive but with it with with frequent flights you can take something like that aircraft that costs ninety million dollars and if it was singleuse youd have to pay half a million dollars per flight but you can actually buy a ticket on Southwest right now from LA to Vegas for 43 including Texas so thats I mean thats a massive improvement right there its showing a four order of magnitude improvement now this is harder the reusability doesnt apply quite as much to Mars because the number of times they can reuse the spaceship is it the spaceship part of the system it is left less often because the Earth Mars rendezvous only occurs every every 26 months so you get to use the spaceship part roughly every two years now you get to use the booster and the tanker as frequently as youd like and so it makes that thats why it really makes a lot of sense to to load the spaceship into orbit with essentially tanks dry and have it have really quite big tanks that you then use the booster and tanker to refill while its in orbit and maximize the the payload of the spaceships that when it goes to Mars if you really have a very large payload capability so I said refueling in orbit is is one of the essential elements of this without refilling in orbit you you would have a half order of magnitude impact roughly on on the cost but by half order magnitude I think audience mostly knows but what that means is each order of magnitude is a factor of 10 so not refilling in orbit would mean a 500 percent roughly increase in the cost per ticket it also analysis to build a smaller vehicle and lower the development cost although this vehicle is quite big but it would be much harder to build something thats 5 to 10 times the size and it also reduces the sensitivity of performance characteristics of the of the booster rocket and tanker so if theres a shortfall in the performance of any of the elements you can actually make up for it by having one or two extra refilling trips to the spaceship so this is its very important for reducing the susceptibility of the system to a performance shortfall and then producing propellant on on rises up actually you know also very obviously important again if if we didnt do this it would have at least a half order of magnitude increase in the in the cost of a trip so five hundred percent increase in the cost of trip and if we pretty absurd to try to build a city on Mars if your spaceships just kept staying on Mars or not going back to earth you have this like massive grade your graveyard of ships if like do something with them so it really wouldnt make sense to to leave your spaceships on Mars you really want to build a propellant plant on Mars and send the ships back so and what happens to work out well for that because it has a co2 atmosphere its got water ice in the soil and with h2o and co2 you do ch4 methane and oxygen o2 so picking the right propellant is also important that sort of think of us is maybe this theres three main choices and Im going to have that they have their merits but kerosene or rocket propellant grade the kerosene which is also what jets use rockets use a very expensive form a highly refined form of jet fuel essentially which is a form of kerosene that it helps keep the vehicle size small but because its a very specialized form of jet fuel its its quite expensive the you reasonably casual is lower very difficult to make this on Mars because theres no oil so really quite difficult to make the Consul Mars and and then propellant transfers because is pretty good but not not great hydrogen although it has a high specific impulse is its very expensive incredibly difficult to to keep from boiling off because liquid hydrogen is very close to absolute zero as a liquid so the installation required is is tremendous and the the cost of in it the energy cost on Mars of producing and storing hydrogen is very high so when we looked at the overall system optimization it was clear to us that that methane actually was the clear winner so we it would require maybe anywhere from you know fifty to sixty percent of the energy on Mars to reach to refill propellants using a propellant Depot and just that the technical challenges are a lot easier so so we think we think methane is actually better on you just really almost across the board and and we started off initially thinking that hydrogen would make sense but ultimately came to inclusion that the the best way to optimize the cost per unit mass to Mars and back is is to use an all methane system or technically deepfryer methyl odds so those are the four the four elements that need to be achieved so this so whatever architecture whatever system is designed whether by SpaceX or or any one we think these are the four features that need to be addressed in order for the system to to really achieve a low cost per cost per ton to the surface of Mars and this is this is a simulation of the oil system Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Applause so what you saw there is its really quite close to what we will actually build it will look almost exactly what you saw like what you saw so this is not an artists impression these that the simulation was actually made from the space six engineering CAD models so this is not you know so it just well this is what it might look like this is what we plan to try to make it look like so in the video you see you got a sense for what the system architecture looks like the the rocket booster and the spaceship takeoff loads the spaceship into orbit the rocket booster then comes back it comes back quite quickly within about 20 minutes and so it can actually launch the tanker version of the spacecraft which is essentially the same as the as a spaceship but filling up the unpressurized and pressurized cargo areas with propellant tanks as they look almost identical this this also helps lower the development cost which obviously will not be small and and then that the propellant tanker goes up and will go actually itll go up multiple times so anywhere from three to five times to fill the tanks of the of the spaceship in orbit and then once the spaceship is the tanks are full the cargo has been transferred and we reached the Mars rendezvous timing which as mentioned is roughly every 26 months thats when the ship would depart no overtime there would be many spaceships you to ultimately have I think upwards of a thousand or more spaceships waiting in orbit and so that the Mars colonial fleet would depart on mass theyre kind of like Battlestar Galactica weve seen that thing thats good good show so a bit like that but if it actually makes sense to load the spaceships into orbit because youve got two years to do so and then make frequent use of the booster and the to get really heavy we use out of those and then with the with the spaceship you get less reuse because you have to say well how long is going to last for maybe 30 years so that might be 12 to maybe 15 flights of the spaceship at most so you really want to maximize the cargo of the spaceship and and and reuse the booster and the tanker alight so heres the ship goes to Mars gets gets propellant replenished and then returns to Earth so Ill go into some of the details of the vehicle design and performance and Im going to gloss over or reduce Ill Ill only talk a little bit about the technical details in the actual presentation and then Ill leave the the detailed technical questions to the to the QA that follows this is to give you a sense of size is quite big Applause and the funny thing is I think in the long term the strips will be even bigger than this I think this will represent this will be relatively small compared to the Mars interplanetary ships of the of the future and but it kind of needs to be about the size because if in order to fit 100 people there abouts in the pressurized section plus carry of the luggage and all of the unpressurized cargo to build propellant plants and both everything from iron foundries to pizza joints to you name it in the we need carry a lot a lot of cargo so it it really needs to be roughly on this on this order of magnitude because if we say like the the that same amount of threshold for selfsustaining city on Mars for civilization would be a million people well and you only go every two years if you if you if you have 100 people per ship thats 10000 trips so I think at least 100 people per trip is is the right order of magnitude and I think we actually may end up expanding the the crew section and and ultimately taking more like 200 or more people per flight in order to reduce the cost per person so its 10000 flights is a lot of life so you really want ultimately I think on the order of a thousand ships it will take a while to build up to a thousand ships and so I think if you say when when we reach that million person threshold from the point of which the first ship goes to Mars its probably served between 20 to 50 total Mars rendezvous so its probably somewhere between there maybe 40 to 100 years to achieve a fully selfsustaining civilization on Mars so thats the request section of the ship and in some ways its not that complicated really the its made primarily of an advanced carbon fiber the common fiber pot is tricky when dealing with deep cryogens and and trying to achieve both liquid and gas impermeability and have and not have gaps occur due to cracking or pressurization that would make the combi velikiy so this is this is a fairly significant technical challenge to make a deeply cryogenic tanks out of carbon fiber and its only recently that the that we think the carbon fiber technology has gone to the point where we can actually do this with without having to create a liner on the in some sort of metal liner why the liner on the inside of the tanks which would add mass and complexity so a particularly tricky for the hot gaseous oxygen pressurization so this is line to be portage asleep pressurize which means that the fuel and the oxygen we gasify them through heat exchanges in the engine and use that to pressurize the tanks so were guessed by the methane and use  pressurize the fuel tank gas by the oxygen use that pressurize the oxygen tank and this compares that this is a much simpler system than what we have with with Falcon 9 where we use helium pressurization and we use nitrogen for gas thrusters in this case we were tottenham exogenous lee pressurized and then use gaseous methane and oxygen for the control thrusters so really only you only need two ingredients for this as opposed to four in the case of Falcon 9 and actually 5 if you consider the ignition liquid so we reuse reserve like its sort of complicated liquid to ignite the engines that isnt is very useful in this case we reduce spark ignition so lets give you a sense of vehicles by performance sort of current and historic you can actually read that but in expendable mode the the vehicle purse that were proposing would do about 550 tons and about 300 tons in reusable mode that compares to satisfied max capability of 135 tons but I think this this really gives a better sense for things the white bars show the performance of the vehicle like there was the payload to orbit of the vehicle so you can see essentially what it represents is whats the size efficiency of the of the vehicle and most drugs including ours as theyre currently flying the the performance bar is only a small percentage of the actual size of the rocket but with the interplanetary system with traditionally the use of Mars weve been able to or we believe massively improve the design performance so its the first time a rockets sort of performance bar will actually exceed the physical size of the rocket this gives you a more direct sort of comparison if this is the thrush level is quite enormous talking about liftoff thrust of 13000 tonnes since we quite quite sec tonic when it takes off but it is it is a fit on pad 39a which nASA has been kind of to allow us to use where it because they sort oversize that the pad in doing Saturn five and and as a result we can actually do a much larger vehicle on that same launch pad and in the future we expect to add additional launch locations probably probably adding one it on the south coast of Texas but this gives you a sense of the capability if you can read those but these vehicles have very different purposes the this is really intended to carry huge numbers of people ultimately millions of tons of cargo to Mars so you really need something quite large in order to do that so talk about some of the key elements of the interplanetary spaceship and rocket booster which scientists are of the development with what we think of probably the two most difficult elements of the of the design one is the the Raptor engine and that this is going to be the highest chamber pressure engine of any any kind revolt and probably the highest thrusttoweight its a its a full flow stage combustion engine which maximizes the theoretical momentum that you can get out of a given source fuel and an oxidizer we serve pull the oxygen and methane to densify it so compared to when it went prepares to normally use theyre used close to their boiling points in in most rockets in our case we actually load the propellants close to the freezing point and that can result in a density improvement of up to around 10 to 12 percent which makes an enormous difference in the in the actual results of the rocket it also makes the it gets rid of any cavitation risk for the turbo pumps and it makes it easier to feed a highpressure turbo pump if you have very cold propellant really one of the keys here though is the the vacuum version of rapture having a 382 second ISP that this is really quite critical to to the whole last mission and were confident that number or at least within a few seconds of that number ultimately maybe exceeding it slightly so the rocket the rocket booster in many ways is is really a scaled up version of the Falcon 9 booster youll see a lot of similarities such as the grid fins obviously clustering a lot of engines at the base and the big difference really being that the primary structure is advanced form a carbon fiber as opposed to aluminum lithium and that we use autogenous pressurization and and we get rid of the helium and the nitrogen so this uses 42 raptor engines its a lot of engines but we use nine on a falcon 9 and with falcon heavy which should launch early next year theres this 27 engines on the base so weve got pretty good experience with having a large number of engines it also gives us redundancy so that if some of the engines fail you can still continue the mission and be fine but the main job of this of the booster is to accelerate the spaceship to around eight and a half thousand kilometres an hour and for for those that are less familiar with orbital dynamics really its all about velocity and not about height so really thats the job of the booster the boosters like the javelin thrower sort of its going to toss that javelin which is the mr spaceship in in the case of other planets though which happen which have a gravity well which is not as deep so Mars of the moons of Jupiter specifically one day maybe even Venus the Venus will be a little trickier but for most of the solar system you only need the spaceship so you dont you dont need the booster if you have a lot of gravity well so no booster is needed on the Moon or Mars or any of the moons of Jupiter or Pluto you just need the spaceship the booster is just there for heavy gravity wells and then weve also been able to optimize the propellant needed for Bruce back in landing to get it down to about seven percent of the liftoff propellant load and we think with some optimization we can get it down to about six percent and were also not getting quite comfortable with the accuracy of the landing if youve been watching the Falcon 9 landings youll see that theyre getting increasingly increasingly closer to the bullseye and we think particularly with the addition of additional with addition of some thrusters and maneuvering thrusters we can actually put the booster right back on the road stand and then those spins at the base are essentially centering features to take out any minor position mismatch at the lower side so it looks like at the base so we think we only need two gimble or steer the center cluster of engines so theres the seven engines in the center cluster those will be the ones that that move force during the rocket and the other ones would be fixed in position which gives us the best concentration of we can max out the number of engines because you dont have to leave any room for gambling or moving the engines and and like that this is all designed so that you could actually lose multiple engines even at liftoff or anywhere in flight and continue the mission safely so the for the spaceship itself in the top we have the the pressurized compartment Ill show you a flying three of that in a moment and then beneath that is the is where wed have the unpressurized cargo which would be really flat packed in very dense format and and it below that is the liquid oxygen tank the the production tank is probably the hardest piece of this whole vehicle because its going to handle propellant to call this level and it and the tanks themselves actually form the proform the airframe so the the airframe structure and the tax structure are combined as it is in all modern rockets and in aircraft for example the wing is really a fuel tank in in wing shape so that it has to take the thrust loads of ascent the loads of reentry and and then it has to be impermeable to gaseous oxygen which is which is tricky and and non reactive to gaseous oxygen so thats thats the hardest piece of the spaceship itself which is actually why we started on that element as well and Ill show you some pictures that are later so and they blow the oxygen tank is the fuel tank and then the engines are mounted directly to the thrust cone on the base and then there there are there are six of the vacuum the highefficiency vacuum engines around the perimeter and those are those those dont gimbal and and I know three of the clevel versions of the engine which do gimbal and provide the steering although we can do some some amount of steering if youre in space by it with differential thrust on the outside engines the net effect is a cargo to Mars of up to 450 tons depending upon how many refills you do with the the tanker and the goal is at least 100 passengers per ship although I think ultimately will policy that number grow to 200 or more this charts a little difficult to interpret it first but I can we decided to put it there for people who want to watch the video afterwards and and to take a closer look analyze some of the numbers the column on the left is probably whats most relevant and thats that gives you the trip time so depending upon which earth one is rendezvous graining for the trip time at 6 kilometres per second departure velocity can be as low as 80 days and then over time I think would obviously improve that and ultimately I suspect that youd see Mars transit times of as well as 30 days in in the more distant future so its fairly manageable considering the trips that people used to do in the old days it routinely take sailing voyages that would be six months of warm so uh narai bowl the the heat shield technologies is extremely important weve been refining the the heat shield technology using our Dragon spacecraft and we now have were not version 3 of pica which is phenolic impregnated carbon ablator and getting more more robust with each new version with with less ablation more resistance less need for refurbishment the heat shield is basically a giant brake pad so its like how good can you make that brake pad against extreme reentry conditions and minimize the look at the cost of refurbishment and make it so that you could have many flights with no refurbishment at all this is a fly through of the the crew compartment its going to give you a sense of what it would feel like to actually be in the spaceship I mean in order to make it appealing and increase that portion of the Venn diagram where people actually want to go its got to be really fun and exciting and it cant feel cramped or boring so the the crew the crew compartment or the Aqua compartment is setups that you can do zerog games you can float around theyll be like movies lecture polls your cabins a restaurant itll be like really fun to go you can have a great time so with the propellant plant on Mars I guess this is one of those slides that I would go into in detail here but people can think about oh client the the key point being that the ingredients are there on Mars to create a propellant plant with relative ease because the atmosphere is primarily co2 and theres water ice almost everywhere youve got the the co2 plus h2o to make methane ch4 and oxygen o2 using the savatya reaction that the the trickiest thing really is the the energy source which we think we can do with the large build of solar panels so then to give you a sense of the cost really the key is is making this affordable to almost anyone who wants to go and we think based on this architecture this architecture assuming optimization over time like the very first flights wouldnt be would be fairly expensive but the architecture allows for a cost per ticket of less than 200000 maybe as less may be as little as 100000 over time depending upon how much mass a person takes so were right now estimating about one hundred and forty thousand dollars per ton to the surface of Mars so if a person plus the luggage is than that taking it about account food consumption and life support then we think that the cost of moving to Mars ultimately could drop below 100000 so finding these are thought about finding sources and so we could steal Underpants launch satellites send cargo to space station Kickstarter force followed by profit so the obviously its going to be a challenge to to fund this whole endeavor we do expect to generate very decent net net cash flow from launching lots of satellites and servicing the space station for NASA of transferring hager to and from space station and and then I know that theres a lot of people in the private sector who are interested in helping fund a base on Mars and then perhaps there will be interest on the government sector side to also do that ultimately this is going to be a huge publicprivate partnership and I think thats thats thats how the United States was established and many other countries around the world is a publicprivate partnership so I think thats probably what what occurs and right now were just trying to make as much progress as we can with the resources that we have available and just sort of keep keep moving both forward and hopefully I think I think as we as we show that this is possible that this dream is real not just a dream its something that we made real I think the support will snowball over time and I should say also the the main reason Im personally accumulating assets is in order to fund this so I really dont have any other motivation for personally accumulating assets except to be able to make the biggest contribution I can to making life multiplanetary Applause timelines not the best at this sort of thing but just to show you where we started off in 2002 SpaceX basically consisted of carpet and a mariachi band but that was it thats thats thats all of SpaceX in 2002 as you can see Im a dancing machine and yeah I believe in kicking over celebratory events with mariachi bands I really like Maury insurance but that was what we started off with in 2002 and really I mean I thought we had maybe a 10 chance of doing anything of even getting rocked to overt let alone getting beyond that and and and taking Mars seriously but Ive I came clusion that if they were if it wasnt some new entrance into into the space arena with a strong ideological motivation then it didnt seem like we were on a trajectory to ever be a spacefaring civilization and be out there among the stars because in 69 we were able to go to the moon and the Space Shuttle could get to lowearth orbit and then observational got retired but that trend line is down down to zero so I think what a lot of people dont appreciate is that technology does not automatically improve it only improves if a lot of really strong engineering talent is applied to the problem that it improves and there are many examples in history where civilizations have reached a certain technology level and then have fallen well below that and and and then recovered only millennia later so we go from 2002 were basically were clueless and then I felt with Falcon one the smallest useful orbital rocket that we could think of which would deliver half a turn tor but and it four years later we developed the built the first the first vehicles we dropped the main inch in the upper stage engine the the airframes the fairing and the launch system and had our first attempt at launch in 2006 which failed so that lasted about 60 seconds unfortunately but but 2006 four years after starting is also when we we actually got our first national contract and i just want to say Im incredibly grateful to NASA for supporting SpaceX you know despite the fact that a rocket crashed was awesome well hello im NASAs biggest fan so yeah I think thank you very much to the people that have the faith to do that thank you Applause so then 2006 followed by a lot of grief and then finally the fourth launch of Falcon one worked in 2008 and we were really down to our last ponies in fact I only thought I had enough money for three launches and first three buddy failed and we were able to scrape together enough to just barely make it and do do a fourth launch and that thank thank goodness that fourth launch succeeded in 2008 I was a lot of pain and and then mostly at the end of 2008 is when were NASA awarded us the first signal first major operational contract which was for resupplying cargo to the space station of bringing cargo back then a couple years later we did the first launch of Falcon 9 version 1 and that had about it a tenton to open capability so it was about 20 times the capability of Falcon 1 and also was signed to to carry our dragon spacecraft then 22 2010 is our first mission to the space station so we were able to finish development of Dragon and dock with the space station in 2010 so sorry 220 our 20 is expandable module drag expendable Dragon 2012 when we delivered and return cargo from the space station 2013 when we first started doing a vertical takeoff or landing tests and then 2014 is when were able to have the first orbital booster do a soft landing in the ocean the landing was soft wood fell over exploded but landing for seven seconds it was good and we also improved the capability of the vehicle from 10 tonnes to about 13 tonnes Tulio and then 2015 rule last year in December I was definitely one the best moment of my life when the rocket booster came back and landed at Cape Canaveral I was really yeah Applause so that really sure that we could bring an orbit class booster back from a very high velocity all the way to the launch site and landed safely and and with with almost no refurbishment required for reef light and if things go well were hoping to reef lie one of landed boosters in a few months so yeah and then 2016 were also demonstrated landing on on a ship the landing of the ship is important for the very high velocity geosynchronous missions and thats thats important for feasibility of Falcon 9 because about roughly a quarter of our missions are sort of servicing the space station and then theres a few other lowearth orbit missions but most of our missions probably 60 of our missions are commercial geo missions so weve got to do these high velocity permissions that really need to land on a ship out to sea they dont have enough propellant on board to boost back to the launch site so looking at the future next steps we were kind of intentionally a bit fuzzy about the timeline but the were going to try to make as much progress as we can obviously its with a very constrained budget but were going to try to make as much progress as we can on the elements of the interplanetary transport Brewster and spaceship and hopefully well be able to do to complete the first development spaceship in maybe about four years and start doing suborbital flights with with that in fact actually has enough capability that you could maybe even go to orbit what if you limit the amount of cargo with the spaceship of it well you have to really have to really strip it down but in tanker form it can definitely get to orbit kick it back we can get to orbit it actually starts thinking like maybe there is some market for really fast transport of stuff around the world provided we can land somewhere where noise is not a super big deal rockets are very noisy but we could transport cargo to anywhere on earth in 45 minutes at the longest so most places on earth to be maybe 20 25 minutes so maybe if we had a floating platform out off the coast of you know say or of Costa New York I said 20 30 miles out you could go from you know New York to Tokyo in 125 minutes across the Atlantic in 10 minutes as really most your time would be getting to the ship and then every real quick after that so theres some intriguing possibilities there although were not counting on that and then and then develop another booster we actually think the booster part is is relatively straightforward because weve its it amounts to scaling up of the Falcon 9 booster so theres we dont see a lot of sort of showstoppers there yeah so then but theyre trying to put it all together and make this actually work for Mars if things go super well it might be kind of in the 10 year time frame but that this does look I dont want to say thats when it will occur its like this huge amount of risk its going to cost a lot good chance we dont succeed but were going to do our best and try to make as much progress as as possible yeah alright and were going to try to send something to Mars on every monitor view from here on out so dragon 2 which is a propulsive lander we plan to send Mars in in a couple years and and then do probably another dragon mission in 2020 in fact we want to establish steady cadence that theres always a flight leaving like its train leaving the station with every monster on it we we will be transfer well be sending a dragon at least a dragon to Mars and all smoothly the big spaceship so if they feel that interested in putting payloads on on Dragon you know you can count on a ship thats going to transport something in order of at least two or three tons of useful payload to the surface of Mars Applause yes thats thats par the reason why we design Dragon 2 to be a propulsive Lander is as a propulsive landing you can you can go anywhere in the solar system so you could go to the moon you go to well anywhere really whereas if something relies on parachutes or wings then you can pretty much only well if its if its a wings you can pretty much on the land on earth because you need a runway most places dont have a runway and then any place doesnt have a dense atmosphere you cant use parachutes so but propulsive works anywhere so dragon should be capable of landing on any solid liquid surface in the in the solar system and then I was really excited to see that the team managed to do the all up raptor engine firing in advance of this conference the the I suppose say thanks to to the Raptor team for really working seven days a week to try to get this done of in advance of the presentation so I really want to show that weve made some hardware progress in this direction and and the Raptor is a really tricky entrance its a lot trickier than then Mullen because its a full flow stage combustion much higher pressure and Im kind of amazed didnt blow up on the first firing but fortunately it was it was good these kind of interesting see the mock diamonds forming Applause so the apart and Potters for making the engine sort of small like Raptor although it has three times the thrust of a melon is actually only about the same size as a real intention because it has three times the operating pressure and that means we can use a lot of the production techniques that weve honed with Merlin were currently producing Merlin engines at almost three hundred per year so we understand how to make rocket engines in volume so even though the demise vehicle uses 42 on the base and mine on the upper stage so were 51 engines to to make that thats well within our production capabilities for Merlin and this is a similarly similarly sized engine to Merlin except for the expansion ratio so we feel really comfortable about being able to make this engine in volume at at a price that doesnt doesnt break our budget and then we also want to make progress on the primary structure so as I mentioned this this is really a very difficult thing to make is to make something out of carbon fiber even the compiler has incredible strength to weight when when you want one of them put a super cold liquid oxygen and liquid methane a particularly liquid oxygen in the tank is subject to to cracking and leaking and its a its a variable thing to make just the sheer scale of it is also challenging because youve got to lay out the carbon fiber and exactly right way on a huge mold and youve got to cure that mold at temperature and and then its and then its just really hard to make large large carbon fiber structures that that can do all of those things and carry incredible loads so so thats thats the other thing we want to focus on with the Raptor and then the first development tank for the Mars spaceship so yeah like say this this is that this is really the hardest part of the other spaceship the other pieces are we we have pretty good handle on but this was the trickiest one so we want to tackle it first you get a size for how big the tank is its really very quite big also big congratulations to the team that worked on that they also were working seven days a week to try to get this done in advance of the IAC and so that we managed to build the first tank and initial tests with the cryogenic propellant actually looked quite quite positive we have not seen any leaks or major issues this is what the tank looks like on the inside so you can get a real sense for how much just how big this tank is the its actually completely smooth on the inside but the way that the carbon 5 applies lay out and reflect the light makes it look look faceted so then what about beyond Mars so as we thought about the system and the reason we call it a system because generally I dont like pulling things systems because everythings a system including your dog the is that is that its actually more than a vehicle theres this absolute the rocket booster the spaceship the tanker and the propellant plant the the Institute a propellant production if you have all of those four elements you can actually go anywhere in the solar system by by planet hopping or moon hopping so by establishing a propellant Depot on in the asteroid belt or on one of the moons of Jupiter you can go to you can make flights from Mars to Jupiter no problem in fact even from even without a propellant II for at Mars you can do a flyby of Jupiter without a penalty boat so but but by establishing propellant deeper lets say you know Enceladus or grow up for work or any of these few options and then doing another one on Titan Jupiter Saturn moon and it perhaps another one further out on Pluto or elsewhere in the solar system this system really gives gives you freedom to go anywhere you want in the greater solar system so you can actually travel out to the Cape of L to the earth cloud I wouldnt recommend this for interstellar journeys but this just this basic system provided we have filling stations along the way it means full access to the entire Greater Solar System Applause no its not its it theres no need even to have a college degree at all or even high schools the I mean if somebody graduated from a great university that maybe an Indian in dication that they will be capable of great things but its not necessarily the case you know if you look at say people like Bill Gates for Larry Ellison Steve Jobs these guys didnt graduate from college but if you had a chance to hire them of course that would be a good idea so you know just really looking just for evidence of exceptional ability and if theres a track record of exceptional achievement then its likely that that will continue into the future how I describe myself well I mean I seem to have a high innate drive and thats been true even since I was a little kid you know really had a very strong Drive did all sorts of risky things for his kid that I like why did I do those things are crazy I care a lot about the truth of things and trying to understand the truth of things I think so I think thats important if youre going to come up with some solution then the truth is really really important I think I try to think of I mean its its difficult obviously come up with like things that are praise for oneself you know or like it theres and theres bad and good here but I think like sometimes theyre just like the things that seem quite clear and obvious to me and I I I dont understand why they arent so obvious to everyone so how would you educate your five boys actually I created a little school hahaha yeah what kind of school could you describe sure its I mean its small its only got 14 kids now and itll have 20 kids and in September its called ad astra which means to the stars thats maybe a bit different from from most of the schools is that there arent any grades theres no theres no like look grade 1 grade 2 grade 3 type of thing Im making all the children go and that in the same grade at the same time like an assembly line I know you know cuz some people love English or languages some people love math some people love music and and different abilities different times it makes more sense to to cater the education to match their aptitudes and abilities its like thats one principle another is that its important to teach teach problem solving or teach to the problem not to the tools so this would be like lets say youre trying to teach people about how engines work before you know you could start by the more traditional approach would be to say were going to teach you all about screwdrivers and wrenches and and you even have a course on screwdrivers a course on wrenches and all these things and its this is a very difficult way to do it a much better way would be like heres the engine now lets take it apart how are we going to take it apart oh you need a screwdriver thats what the screwdrivers for you need a wrench thats what the wrench is for and then a very important thing happens which is that the relevance of the tools becomes apparent so all five boys are in that school yes until when this is from when youre old haha they like it they like it yeah and you want to keep them away from regular schools no I just didnt see that the regular schools just they werent doing the things that I thought should be done like you know those two principals they werent adhering to those principles so I thought well lets see what we can do maybe creating a school will be better and actually hired a teacher from the school they were at you also agreed with me that there was a better way to do it have they surprised you in a way of their innovative thinking yeah it seems to be going pretty well I mean I the kids really love going to school I think thats a good sign you know I mean I hated going to school when I was a kid it was torture so the fact that they like they actually think occasions are too long mmm they want to go back to school yeah exactly I know what is it well I mean those are pretty different personalities in it between gates and jobs and Alisons at success well I think you know all all three of those were technologists but with different types of skills and their jobs was obviously very good with aesthetics and you know against the technology of course and you really insert where people wanted even when they didnt know themselves and he was not afraid to break boundaries but say like gates would probably be better at you know sort of raw engineering and technology than jobs but not as good on aesthetics but I mean for these guys of the obviously very driven and theyre very talented and yeah and theyre able to attract great people to hold a company but I needed that like the the ability to attract and motivate great people is critical to the success of a company because the company is just thats a group of people that are assembled to create a product or service thats the purpose of a company if you all some of us forget this elementary truth and so if you know if youre able to get great people to join the company and work together towards a common goal and and you sort of have a relentless sense of perfection about that goal then you will end up with a great product and have a great product lets if you will buy it and then we kind of know well be successful yeah really its pretty straightforward really yeah I mean yeah thats the reason for it I wouldnt say Im fearless in fact I I think I fear I feel fear quite strongly but I am if the if what were doing isnt you know what Im doing is I think its important enough then I just override the fear so but its not as that I dont feel I feel a little like more stronger than I would like well it really depends on the stakes if the stakes are high if its really important then one should then I you know will overcome the fear and just do it anyway I essentially I mean I just drive over rights fear but I feel the fear its kind of annoying I wish isnt oh Sh I felt it less so yeah these all these introspective questions are interesting I dont get the ask these very often and then like I try to think like what is like an evident an accurate reply and somebody said its like I know its hard to evaluate yourself on these things yeah well probably SpaceX I thought it had the lowest chance of success I mean I thought both Tesla and SpaceX would fail at the beginning you saw it yeah really of course but nevertheless you put all your money in that expected to lose it well technically what I thought was well Ill take half the money from PayPal and if I lose half of it thats okay but then of course the companies encounter difficulties and then have a choice of that you like let the company die or put you know you know all the money into the companies and so I really didnt want the companies to die so I put all the money in the companies yeah and then I had to borrow money for friends should pay living expenses yes what was your best idea ever my best idea ever yeah this is tricky I suppose coming to North America was my best idea okay because I think these things would not have been accomplished anyway you know almost anywhere else its really hard to start a company but you know in particularly California Silicon Valley is very conducive to startup companies and yeah and so yeah you know whenever I read books in South Africa it would seem like the cutting edge of technology was in Silicon Valley and so that thats what I wanted to come and I wanted to move move to this mythical place well theres theres lots of things but you know when life is short and theres lots of things that could be done that one cant necessarily do and these really are introspective questions I think it no I mean Im overall I think Im pretty pretty happy with what wait you know where things are its hard not to be honestly Id be yeah if things are in a good place right now and I mean Id like to at looking ahead Id like to see humanity go beyond Earth and have people on Mars that would be really great and to see widespread adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy these were great things and yeah thought I thought would be really really cool all for joining us for coming here and also to apologize to the others who couldnt join because we were fully booked very quickly actually when we launched the invitation they can follow the livestream if they are not here and you can find the video tomorrow morning on YouTube so we are pretty well organized actually well actually today is a very special day for our University we are extremely proud and Im particularly very proud to welcome tonight someone very special someone who is probably one of the most influential person of the 20th and 21st centuries someone who is definitely the most creative mind of his generation he is the cofounder and CEO of a revolutionary car manufacturer challenging the mainstream car industry but is also the founder and CEO of a tremendously innovative company actually the first private company to launch and return a spacecraft from orbit and last but not least also the chairman of the larger solar energy provider in the US through his different activities his facing environmental social and economic challenges it deals with breathtaking projects on diverse issues like green mobility clean and renewable sources of energy space exploration so on and so forth by the way among the latest news here done here in France in Europe you probably heard that yesterday was inaugurated a new solar firm in the southern France something which is definitely or actually the biggest hover Europe now selling power at a cost well below the cost of power from the new generation of nuclear reactors and able to provide energy power for more than 50000 households but also and more ver currently Paris is welcoming the UN climate change conference which faces the ice take half hour to manage with the climatic disruption the aim of the cop21 is keeping warming below the 2 degree Celsius compared with the preindustrial here and for that the objective of the cup is to build Paris climate aliens meaning a universal climate agreement committing every one so in that context who better than Elon Musk for conversation with you please welcome Elon Musk huh thank you all right I was thank you for having me its great to be here Paris is so one of my favorite places in the world and its actually be but on the first trip that I went out of South Africa Paris that was where I went when I was a young little kid well my problem my parents brought me I know its like six years old so Ive left Paris ever since so thank you for having me Im gonna talk about today is just in general terms what is needed to address the the climate crisis and this is the thing that if if we if we do what actions can we take that that will accelerate the transition out of the fossil fuel era so where we are today is youre not okay all right were the present era where we have the like the carbon carbon cycle and my apologies if some of you already know all about this but I think some of these things are maybe not as obvious as they may seem so theres a certain amount of carbon that is circulating through the environment so its going into the air being absorbed by an enegry getting absorbed by plants and animals and then getting back into the air and this this carbon is just circulating on the surface and this this is fine and its been doing that for millions hundreds of millions of years the the thing thats changed is that weve added something to the mix so this is what I would call the sort of the turd in the punchbowl so the we added all this extra carbon to the carbon cycle and the net result is that with the the carbon and oceans atmosphere is growing over time its much more than can be absorbed by the ecosystem its its really its really quite simple were taking billions of tons of carbon thats been buried for hundreds of millions of years and is not part of the carbon cycle taking from deep underground and adding it to the carbon cycle the result is that a steady increase in the the carbon in the atmosphere and in the ocean oceans which doesnt look like much if you look at on this chart but when looked at in the context of history it actually looks like this so the carbon plants million has really been bouncing around the 300 level for around ten million years and then in the last few hundred years it went into a vertical climb this this is the the essence of the problem this is very unusual and a very very extreme threat as you can see from from this rate of growth then this is accompanied by a temperature increase as one would expect and and then and then this temperature increase if people talk about two degrees or three degrees its important to appreciate just how sensitive the climate actually is to to temperature and its important to look at it in terms of absolute temperature not in degrees Celsius relative to zero we need to say what is the temperature change relative to absolute zero thats how the universe thinks about temperature its not physics thinks about temperature its its relative to absolute zero so for small changes result in huge effects so New York City under ice would be 5 degrees New York City under water would be plus 5 degrees but looked at in an abyss as a percentage relative to absolute zero its only a plus minus two percent change so that the the sensitivity of the climate is extremely extremely high weve amplified the sensitivity by building our cities right on the on the coastline and most of it most people live very close to to the ocean in some countries of course that are their very lowlying and would be completely underwater in in a in a climate crisis so then weve essentially designed civilization to be super sensitive to climate change and the important thing to appreciate is that we are going to exit the fossil fuels era so it is it is inevitable that we will exit the first we watch the era because at a certain point we will simply run out of carbon to mine and burn so the question is really when when do we exit the era not not if the goal is to exit the era as quickly as possible that means we need to move from from the old goal with a preindustrial growth goal which was to move from chopping down forests and killing lots of whales that the old goal was to move from from chopping wood and and killing whales to fossil fuels which is actually in that context was a good thing but the new goal is to move to a sustainable energy future and we want to use things like hydro solar wind geothermal nuclear is also a good option in places like France which dont arent subject to natural disasters and and we want to use energy sources that will be good for for a billion years so how do we accelerate this transition away from fossil fuels to a sustainable era and and and and what happens if we dont see if we if we wait and if we delay the change the best case the best case is simply delaying that inevitable transition to sustainable energy so this is the this is the best case if we dont take action now at the risk of being repetitive its theres gonna be no choice in the long term to move to sustainable energy its tautological we have to have sustainable energy or something run out of the other one so the the only thing we gain by slowing down the transition is is just learning it down it doesnt doesnt make it not occur it just slows it down the worst case however is more displacement and destruction than all the wars in history combined okay this is these are these the best worstcase scenario so then we have about three percent of scientists that believe in the best case about 94 7 percent that believe in the worst case this is why I call it the dumbest experiment in history ever why would you do this so the reason that the transition is delayed or Thor voice is happening slowly is because there is a hidden subsidy on all carbon producing activity in a healthy market if you have say 10 euros of benefit and four years of harm to society the profit would be 6 euros the sort of you know makes a big obvious sense this is where the incentives are aligned with a good future this is not this is not the case today but if you have the incentives aligned then the forcing function towards at a good future towards a sustainable energy future will be powerful in an unhealthy market you have your 10 years of benefit if your 4 years but before yours doesnt isnt taxed so you have an untaxed negative externality this is basically economics 101 so you have basically unreasonable profit and a forcing function to to do carbon emitting activity because this this this cost to society is not being paid the net result is 35 gigatons of carbon per year into the atmosphere so this is analogous to not paying for garbage collection and its not as though we should we should say in the case of garbage have a garbage free society its very difficult to have a garbage free society but its just important that people 14 garbage collection so we need to go from having untaxed negative externality and if which is effectively a hidden carbon subsidy of enormous size 53 trillion dollars a year according to the IMF every year we need to move away from this and and and and have a carbon tax so but this is being this is being fought quite hard by the the carbon producers and theyre using tactics that are very similar to what the cigarette industry or the tobacco industry used for many years what they would they would take the approach of having of even though the overwhelming scientific consensus was that swagging cigarettes was bad for you they would find a few scientists that would disagree and then they would say look scientists disagree so that thats essentially how they would try to trick the public into thinking that smoking isnt that bad the solution obviously is to remove the subsidy so that means we need to have a rail a carbon tax and to make it sort of something which is neither a left nor right issue we should make it a probably a revenue neutral carbon tax so this would be a case of increasing taxes on carbon but then reducing taxes in other places so maybe there would be a reduction in sales tax or v80 and an increase in carbon tax so that only those using high degree levels of carbon would pay an increased tax and moreover this I mean in order to give industry time to react this could be a phased in approach so that maybe it takes 5 years before the the carbon taxes are very high so that means that only companies that dont take action today will suffer in five years but there needs to be a clear message from from government in this regard but because the fundamental problem is the rules today incent people to create carbon and this is madness and whatever you incent will happen but thats why were seeing little very little effect thus far and depending upon how what what action we take will drive the the carbon number to either extreme or moderate levels I think its pretty much a given that that the twodegree see increase will occur the question is whether its going to be much more than that not if there will be a two degree increase so that then the question is Oh what can you do I would say whenever you have the opportunity talk to your politicians ask them to enact a carbon tax we have to fix the unpriced externality Ill talk to your friends about it and fight the propaganda from the carbon industry so that thats the basic message I have and Im happy to take questions so we have we have some mics in the audience being passed around you wanna raise your hand and well give you a mic hi sir hey Im criminal past from the master of inter innovation and technology management management and my question is what do you say to those who think there are more important concerns right now then climate change and global warming sure I mean theres definitely there are many important issues in the world this is not the only important issue but it is I think the thing that will have the biggest negative effect on humanity if we do not address it I mean it based on on the projections that were seeing right now these are like I said arguably bestcase projections were going to see significant rises in temperature and sea level the the net result is if we dont take action we could see you know anywhere from five to ten percent maybe maybe more of the landmass absorbed by water which would which is maybe not its in sound like that much but about a third of humanity lives right on the on the coastline or in lowlying countries so wed be talking about maybe two billion people being displaced and and their home is being destroyed in their countries being gone so I think we should take action hello sir thank you for coming here my question is Im PhD student in marketing and what I study is what motivates people to participate in challenges now you have created a company which creates challenges which brought a rocket to moon and back if I if Im not wrong my question would be do you think a challenge may be not moving back right yeah getting there my question to you would be do you think that incentives which is the biggest incentive to use monetary incentives are the best possible incentive to get people to participate and solve the worlds biggest problems or do you think people can do it in order to just help everyone on the planet and make it better so is money the only way to put it ask people to get in and solve challenges or do you have other ways to actually motivate people to participate I think theres definitely a philanthropic element and theres the you know I think theres I think in general people want to do the right thing and they want to do whats good the the issue we have right now is that the rules fundamentally favor the bad outcome so when youre fighting for the good outcome and its an uphill battle it its just its just slower so with respect to to climate change its just critical at the government and the government is the center of rules the government decides what rules companies will play by and if we currently have a system which massively incensed bad behavior so even if most people dont do the bad behavior some people will still do the bad behavior yeah I mean money and prices our prices are basically just an information mechanism theyre just theyre just basically they tell you that its moneys mostly an information mechanism for labor labor allocation and folk you know and sort of tells companies what to do so its just critical this is why its so critical to be that actually be taken at a government level because the government is the one theyre setting the rules of the game and and its just crazy to have the rules of the game favor a bad outcome my name is Michelle Im an undergrad in econo here a very solvent something also been tire my question is there are some new studies on removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and burrowing deep in the ocean do you think its a sustainable solution and why thank you you know Im not aware of any carbon sequestration or carbon storage system that is that that that works and works economically and and I definitely wouldnt want to we wouldnt want to store the carbon in the ocean because of possible acidification you know as the as the carbon as a co2 levels rise in the atmosphere some of that is absorbed into the ocean becomes carbonic acid and a lot of the shellfish in particular are super sensitive to changes in in pH level so I would definitely or against it when stored in the ocean there potentially you could try to store some of it in giant underground caverns but the sheer quantity were talking about I dont think can be stored anywhere theres just theres just no nowhere to store it yeah and how long do you do Tesla Motors in intends to use lithium batteries knowing that it is not a limited resource well actually I think so lithium in terms of energy storage lithium I think is is definitely the future and will be for a long time that theres actually not as a shortage of lithium on earth so lithium is you know number three on the periodic table its actually extremely common any salty water has as lithium so that there definitely wont be at lithium constraint on energy storage for batteries so I feel pretty confident that one could make enough batteries to store all the energy that the world needs with the current resources that are that are available hello my name is Eden Valley I am a PhD student in project and infrastructure finance in Cirebon first of all I would like to thank you for your latest product power wall which to me it gives to the citizens to have the power to select the way they can consume energy I can spend few thousand dollars to buy some solar panel and the power wall and to be free of any offer in the market my question is about the largest scale storage systems you have designed have you received any serious involvement from governments and large companies to develop such such infrastructure or you have any serious plans within within the United States or maybe in other countries for large energy storage yeah we do actually weve got a number of very very big storage projects underway with utilities around the world so both in the US and outside the the thing thats interesting about at the energy storage situation is that even even without renewables theres a huge potential to make the energy grid more efficient and to be able to shut down the the heaviest polluting power plants because the the energy consumption through the day it usually changes by a factor of two or more so an instance with the exception of hydroelectric you cant store the power it has to be available in real time the world has somewhere between two to three times as many power plants as it actually needs so if you can buffer the power with big big stationary battery packs then you can actually shut down the worst half of the power plants in the world so I think thats a sort of a very exciting thing that I think a lot of people dont appreciate and I think its its gonna make it make a big difference hi sir and coming from the master degree innovation and technology management and my question is do you believe that in the ability of government international government to present climate change and what would you suggest yeah absolutely I think is fundamentally is a government issue so its its its the as mentioned the governments the one that sets the rules of the game that they said I hope you know how companies are rewarded financially and so in the absence of government actually establishing some kind of a carbon tax or potentially a capandtrade on carbon which I was very excited to see that China announced earlier this year that they were going to do that unless the government does something to fix the market Matic mechanism the its were fundamentally going to have a very slow transition out of the fossil fuel era so its its critical that government action changed the incentive structure yeah and that would be very clear and so its like hopefully what comes out of this out of these the climate talks in Paris is that the governments of the world say that we need to put their foot down and I say five years from now lets say there has to be a huge change and and the and that companies know for sure that this is going to happen and if they do then that the the investment decisions they make today will bear fruit in five years so the for for heavy industrial applications or for heavy industry you kind of know what the worlds gonna look like in five years if you know what what what what factories are being built today because if you build a really big factory to get to full production takes about five years from from the start and so since we know that today there are very few sustainable energy projects at large scale that are that are being built we know that unless something changes very quickly the sustainable energy will still be in a bad situation five years from now so you know I mean there are companies like you know at Tesla and SolarCity were quite ideologically motivated but but thats thats relatively unusual so my name is Thomas what do you think about people who are saying then rather than trying to save the earth we should try to colonize other planets well I think we should do both yeah I think we yeah the I mean my sort of personal ideology is its kind of split right now between trying to be helpful on earth related stuff which is sustainable energy and then trying to you know advance space technology so we can establish selfsustaining city on Mars but I do think its important to be a multi planet not just one planet but another planet so the and and the overarching goal is to minimize existential risk you know so if we look at look out into the future and say what are the things that pose a risk to humanity to what what what what what is gonna make the future good versus bad and I think if up see if we have a sustainable energy future thats good and the faster that comes the better and then if were multiplanet species that gives us much more resilience against an extinction event and also would be a really great and fun adventure hi my name is Joe Aida and I wanted to know in your opinion what would the future will look like intermittent energy sources and how soon could we use nuclear fusion efficiently thank you sure well the the thing to appreciate about the industry being sort of installed industrial base is that its its really enormous like the number of petrol and diesel cars on the road and trucks is about 2 billion there are sort of hundreds of thousands of of power plants using fossil fuels so the the even if we if today we went super hard in the direction of renewables it would still take a long time so I think we will its before we see significant changes probably 10 or 20 years and and thats theres a lot that can happen in 10 or 20 years of course so the faster we can bring that date forward the better hi my name is Natasha Im from the master program of sustainable development I have two questions first one because I want to be optimistic that we are going to switch at some point to be completely sustainable and to use renewable energies do you think that theyre gonna be a gap between developing and developed countries that and when developing countries will be able to reach developed ones switching into sustainable and renewable energies second one would be sustainability of nuclear energy in your opinion thank you sure and I actually I should answer the nuclear question because that was how boys just just before this um I actually think that like nuclear fission if its in a location that is not subject to natural disasters like like in the case of France theres a very high percentage of nuclear I think thats actually a good thing obviously you dont want to have nuclear fission power plants in places that are subject to natural disasters because that obviously it can go wrong so and so I think fission is a good is a good approach Fusion is also interesting and its exciting to see whats happening with the ITER project which is a fusion plant thats being built in France III do think fusion is is a feasible technology I think we can definitely make fusion work the but but it is it is a theres kind of a faroff technology so to make fusion at the power plant level work is probably I dont know 30 years away and and a lot of lot of effort so the thats why in at least you know for now and I think maybe even in the long term Im a proponent of using the big fusion power plant in the sky called the Sun so that the Sun is a giant fusion explosion and it it shows up every day and if we have photovoltaics or solar panels we can capture that fusion energy it also needs to be stored in batteries so we can use it at night and then we want to have high power light lines to transfer a solar energy from one place to another so but the important thing to appreciate is like if if lets say the only thing we had was with solar energy that that was the only power source you could if you just took a small section of Spain you could power all of Europe its its a very small amount of area thats actually needed to generate the electricity we need to power civilisation or in the case of the us like a little corner of Nevada or Utah power the entire United States you do have a very impressive and stimulating career you succeeded in business while staying true to yourself and beliefs so I would like to know what advice you would give to a young entrepreneur who is aware of climate change issues and maybe what was the best and the worst advice you are given about that thank you okay well I think if somebodys once loosely entrepreneurial and energy I mean either either you want to start a company or you want to join a company thats doing something sustainable and it could be you know theres this of obviously wind solar and geothermal this tidal power so I would just say look at companies that are trying to do sustainable energy and decide if you want to join them or if you want to start one so I wouldnt you know starting companies in in either the automotive arena or the image like Energy Arena is of like quite a tricky business I mean when we first started at Tesla and SolarCity we thought they would fail before Tesla in particular we thought probably weve maybe 10 chance of success so its you know particularly particularly cars the you know its its hot its hard to stay alive as a car company honestly theres like this must be one of the worst risk adjusted returns yeah my name is Benjamin and I was wondering what do you wish for in terms of international rules and politics to facilitate implementation of your power wall battery well its really that what Ive been saying here is that that the government of the world need to price the the externality they need to put put a proper price on carbon and then automatically the right behavior will occur so this is by putting a price on carbon were essentially fixing and a pricing error in the markets market system so I mean most of the times when government governments intervene in markets its usually increases the pricing error but in but when when the pricing error is a huge tragedy of the Commons issue like we have with carbon capacity its critical that the government put a price on it because you just cant go wrong I put it fight you in any price you put it will be more right than close to zero which it is right now so this is this is by far the most important thing if we want to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy there are other less effective ways by providing incentives and subsidies to say electric cars or solar but that that is that is a sometimes a more politically expedient way to do it but the best way is just to directly fix the pricing error by taxing carbon and this is Id like if you ask most economists they would say the same thing so this is sort of what wellknown and Ive seen they caught economics world even could you say a few words on artificial intelligence because I you know I think I read or you you you know you were quarter than among others Bill Gates and Peter Thiel and so forth saying that you know you were afraid of the that one day and hyper you know intelligent machine would destroy humanity and you know are you investing a lot into artificial intelligence with you know because are we wasting a lot of energy because were using you know were not being smart or were not having smart objects and so forth and how do you reconcile the two if you know theres a this long time you know long term major risk yeah I definitely want to stay stay on the you know sustainable energy topic because its easier to get get derailed on too many other things but yeah I mean I think I just think we should be cautious about the advent of AI and a lot of the people that I know that our developing AI are too convinced that that the only outcome is good and we need to consider potentially less good outcomes and to be careful and and and and really to monitor whats happening and make sure the public is aware of whats happening im gabriele Rondon throne I stood innovation here in Cirebon I have a question about fundraising specifically about the fundraising process regarding what Tesla does what is the most difficult thing to raise funds in the beginning not now because now you have a welldeveloped project and the worldwide knows you and knows Tesla also but in the beginning about the industry that you are working about this kind of energy what is the most difficult thing to find investors and also to convince investors and keep what you thought in the beginning throughout the development of the company sure well in the beginning if any of Tesla and SolarCity I mean I thought the the probability of success was was so low that I provided all of the money so all of the money was just came from me personally so I didnt want to ask people other investors for money if I thought we were gonna die because I thought we were so so I invested you know entirely the money that I got from PayPal all of all of that got invested into Tesla Seoul City and SpaceX and and even then we only narrowly survived so you know in 2000 2008 for Tesla we actually closed the financing round on Christmas Eve 2008 it was the last hour of the last day that it was possible and you know that this is one of the tricky things with with something like a car company its like there are good times and bad times and and when the economy goes south then thats when things get really really tricky for a manufacturing company so yeah I mean in the US for example like the only two car companies that havent gone bankrupt in history or forward and Tesla thats it everybody else is bankrupt or went bankrupt at some point you know General Motors Chrysler and and others so so I think we just made it by the skin of our teeth these days the last few years it really Id say in the last two years is when Teslas achieved a level where its not facing imminent death I mean even as recently as early 2013 we were operating with maybe one to two weeks of money hi my name is I would like to ask you dont you think that we need deeper reflection about our dynamic of society because all the solutions are top youre talking about is about efficiency but dont you think that we need to think differently and consume less because right now our DMACC is about confronting problems and going always in the same direction and trying to find the technological innovation to save us yeah I mean I do you think we we should be watch our consumption we shouldnt be wasteful but but II but even if were a really conservative in our use of energy and are very effective with recycling and all sorts of things that that that delays the trade with the the need to move to a sustainable future but it doesnt eliminate it like if we dont have sustainable energy generation that that theres no way that we can conserve our way to to a good future we have to fundamentally make a sustainable energy available I mean on the plus side that theres actually an enormous amount of sense of sustainable energy and the energy from the Sun purse per square kilometre is a gigawatt so if you just had a one kilometer by one kilometer array of solar panels that were generating well it would be receiving a gigawatt of solar energy then at a 20 efficiency youd be generating 200 megawatts so we can actually generate way more energy like probably under a hundred times more energy then we actually need to operate civilization just with solar panels so were just we just need to fix the incentive structure of the world to make sure that that that companies are incented towards sustainable versus unsustainable technology this is fundamentally the problem hello my name is Lilly and Im a physics students Yale University but I graduated here so I have three questions so the first one is sort of political because because you mentioned it you said that scientists sometimes they diverge they have a different opinions and its on anything yeah and thats also probably because sometimes they are financed by a different corporations and so you said that we should stop the propaganda we should try to ask the politicians to set the rules so that we will go in a better direction you know climate you know warming but so that probably goes against the interest of oil companies but as well probably the governments themselves when they have a financial interest so I was thinking perhaps your own I mean perhaps we could have lobbyists ourselves so that would be perhaps an efficient way to to have those rules put into you know so the these rules that the carbon tax would be a parade so thats my first question because also you know France is one of the main importer of nuclear energy so you know trying to ask them for a tax cut carbon tax when themselves are the the people who are making the most money from importing you know a nuclear energy from power plants one question per person for now great but its going kind of an intermediate II you know like solar solar energy okay thats great but perhaps we need to store it with perhaps with lithium batteries but we we want to use like hey sure yeah the last one was not going to go to an end on its own because its not an unlimited resource right maybe pick one out of the three questions you know sure I mean I I think its you know each government should just that they should do the right thing without waiting for without depending upon what other governments are doing like the I think thats you know that theres too much in these climate talks of of countries like trying to only do things if another country does it I mean if some if its if its the right if its the right thing for the future a country should just do it and dont worry about what other countries are doing just do the right thing and many of the countries are so its its really just you know we just want one encourage as many comments as possible to change the rules to incent a good future that this is fundamentally what worked what has to happen or we will substantially delay the transition away from carbon so and and yeah that thats thats why it has to happen and and and Tesla and socially that my companies are very tiny like were tiny tiny companies so the in order for there to be a big move towards sustainability the the the giant companies have to know that that that that is what the governments are demanding for the future and thats what the people are demanding for the future so at the end of day if you know it the governments respond to to flood to to popular pressure like if you tell politicians that that your vote depends on them doing the right thing with climate change that that makes a difference so if theyre having sort of a a fundraising event or dinner party or whatever and at every fundraising event in every dinner party somebodys asking them hey what are you doing about the climate then they will take action so I think you have tremendous power you you have the power to make the change we cant we cant  let me tell you we definitely cant beat the oil and gas industry on lobbyists okay then this is visit that would be a losing battle you know the you know Exxon makes more profit in a year than the value of the entire solar industry in the United States so its like if you take it every solar company United States its less than excellence profit in one year theres no way you can win on money thats impossible anything sir Ive just one small question but very actual do you think the cop21 will be a success you know I am I I have I dont have any real basis for this but I have a good feeling about it I do have a good feeling about it so I think well its gonna be degrees of success so its sort of like like for example like the Copenhagen was was terrible like nothing nothing came out of Copenhagen the Copenhagen climate talks I mean it was basically I think there was a net increase in global warming as a result of that one unfortunately in the case of the Paris talks I think there will be some positive movement and its a question of what degree and I think we need to send a clear message to the negotiating teams and to to the politicians that this time there needs to be significant change this time it something needs to happen hello and thank you for coming my name is Maria and Im a student of international relations here my question to you is this we know that climate is global a common good so how do we get countries with economies relying heavily on fossil fuels on board with climate change which like how do we get those who have the most to lose on board thank you I think I think we just need to turn that argument around and say like look this this is a common good and if we if if countries dont take action that they all will share in in a bad future so that they need that everyone needs to take action and and care about what what the future is going to hold and leave my example so even countries that that are quite dependent on on fossil fuels if they just changed their tax structure they can they can move away from that in you know in a way thats not super disruptive to the economy they its really just a question of collecting like the same amount of taxes but but weighted towards things that we thats that people believe are most likely to be bad instead of things that are most likely to be good and we do this already in you know in in in our tax code we tax alcohol and cigarettes much more than we tax fruits and vegetables its just sort of the sensible things the sensible thing to do and nobody you know you dont and you know here you know country singer well we make lots of fruit you know we make lots of fruits and vegetables so like we want lower taxes or we make lots of Alcohol Tobacco and we want in their lower taxes that like thats a silly debate that its gone and I think the same thing applies to to carbon emissions just just adjust the tax code and the right thing will happen over time and if its graduated over time and you know start so small and become significant in the future then even if youre heavily dependent on carbon today the that that that message of of seeing whats gonna happen in the future will have a huge impact on on the way that any given countrys economy works so so that they will then become not dependent on carbon because of the incentive structure so I really dont think they have anything to lose here and were anything to lose by taking action and a lot to lose by not taking action we have time for maybe two or three more questions so theres one right here hi my question is about batteries so electric bad batteries today especially lithiumion have a significant carbon footprint and potential impacts on both the environment and our health and the environmental impact moves away from consumables and to how the way how we produce and how we store the waste that comes from it so the gap with fossil fuels might not be as wide as we think so my question has how do you respond to this and how do you see this evolving in the next years so Im not sure I totally understand the question could you say that again yeah basically did the impact on the environment of today our ways of Electrical batteries batteries and how do you equate this with fossil fuel and its impact as its more about the production and how we use the waste and how we store the waste and so how do you see this how is this gonna be optimized in the next years or is this gonna change yeah well the one thing is like once you once youve built a battery then at the end of life at the battery you can recycle those components so its its a its its something that you know has no longterm or negligible longterm impact on the carbon cycle because you essentially you get this with lithium and nickel cobalt and and you create to create the battery you created you just essentially get those materials once and then you recycle them forever so I think the the its really a negligible impact for batteries on the environment and yeah and and as compared to carbon producing in mining and birding billions of tons of carbon every year which poop which effectively permanently from from a human standpoint affects the carbon the carbon content of the oceans in atmosphere so yeah its its really what were talking orders of magnitude difference between fossil fuels and batteries like you know not even on the same scale so my question is taking into consideration of a technology now is it some of a breaking point it is advanced but not so advanced to pass to sustainable clean energy how do you see this integration of clean energy in for long term in the future step by step maybe how do I see the integration how do I see us getting to a sustainable energy future yes yes how will will the clean energy integrate into a society taking into consideration that technology isnt advanced sure well I mean I expect you know all transport to go fully electric over time with the ironic exception of rockets and and then all energy production to go sustainable over time this will take this will take a long time in many decades but you know the way itll manifest itself is by people having batteries in their homes or at the utility substation and by driving electric vehicles and having electric planes but as I said that this is this is going to be quite a very slow transition because the incentive structure is so biased against sustainable energy so in fact even I think even if theres quite a strong action by government as a result of the climate talks in Paris I think its still going to be a transition thats measured in decades so it will be it will be a slow a slow transition and and the fundamental question is how do we accelerate that transition that thats the real question here what actions can we take that would accelerate a transition to a good future and thats why Im so so harping on this notion of a revenue neutral carbon tax I think thats something that every country can implement and it can be graduated and facing over time and this is this will be by far the most effective thing for accelerating that transition to a good future all right well thank you for one you you Applause you have to make it compelling and this is really at the key of Tesla is a car that you will covet that you want to draw it that happens to be very good for on the environment yeah exactly I think this is sort of general you know advice Id give to people starting companies entrepreneurs in general is really focus on making a product that your customers love and its so rare that you can buy a product and you love the product when you bought it this is this is there are very few things that fit into that category and if you can come up with something like that your business will be successful for sure but it is generally true that innovation comes from questioning the way things have been done before and if in the education system youre taught not to do that that will inhibit entrepreneurship theres colonies elsewhere in the solar system and ultimately extend beyond the beyond our solar system and and so theres the defensive reason of protecting the future of humanity and sharing that the line of consciousness is not extinguished should some calamity before the earth thats the defense of reason but personally I find the more the word what it gets me more excited is is the fact that this would be an incredible adventure maybe like the greatest adventure ever mmhmm and it would be exciting and inspiring and they need to be things that excite and inspire people yeah after your you know reasons why you get up in the morning it cant just be solving problems its got to be yeah something something great is gonna happen in the future yeah people want to be more like you so and therefore the fate of humankind I think it would be great to have more Elon Musks what do we need to do to become more like Elon all right I dont know if its I think it maybe sounds better than it is theres a friend of mine hes got a great thing about creating a company created trying to build a company and have it succeed is like eating glass and staring into the abyss so I mean what can happen is its sort of quite exciting for the first several months of starting a company and then then reality sets in things that go as well as planned customers arent signing up the technology or the product isnt working as well as you thought and and then can that consumers be compounded by a recession and it can be very very painful for several years frankly starting company advising people to have a high pain tolerance do you fear that maybe an in this generation or the younger generation that they dont have that perseverance Ingrid to take on these really tough challenges I think some people do and I think it is definitely sure that I mean maybe they tional e companies that get created work where theres not an extended period of extreme pain but but Im not aware of you know very many sort of such instances so but I do think that the new great entrepreneurs are born of every day and will continue to see amazing companies get built yeah but I would definitely advise people theres not any company to expect a long period of quite high difficulty but let me song as people stay super focused on creating an absolute best product or service that really delights their end customer if they stay focused on that then it should basically if you get a such that your customers want you to succeed then you probably will all right you have to focus on the customer delivering for them yeah make sure if your customers love you you will your other success or dramatically higher yeah so I noticed I picked up two kind of themes from from what you were discussing one was that somewhat audacious goals and the other was I dont think I heard used word profit and anything that you spoke of but you seem to be each each thing is pointed that reinvigorating in industry or bringing back space missions how much of your success do you attribute to having really audacious goals or versus just not being focused on the short term you know money coming in or their investors approach one one does have to be focused on the short term and money coming in when creating company because otherwise the company will for die so that the I think that a lot of times people think like creating company is going to be fun I would say its not its really not that fun when their periods of fun and their periods of where its where its just awful and particularly if you CEO of the company you actually have a distillation of all the worst problems in a company theres no point in spending your time on things that are going right so you only spend on things on your time on things that are going wrong and theyre things that are going wrong that other people cant cant take care of so you like the worst give a filter for the crappers problems in the company the most pernicious and painful problems so I wouldnt say its I think you have to feel quite compelled to do it and have a fairly high pain threshold and theres a friend of mine who says like starting companies like staring at the abyss and eating glass theres some truth to that were sharing its the best part is that youre going to be constantly facing the extermination of the company because most most startups fail now its like 90 percent ugly 99 of of startzville so I so you that thatsa staring into the abyss plug you cant constantly saying okay if I dont get this right the company will die and and then youre eating glass parties youve got youve got to do youve got to do the problems youre gonna so youre gonna work on the problems that the company needs you to work on that problems you want to work on and so that the unit working on problems that that youd really wish you werent working on and so thats the eating glass part then that goes on for a long time so how do you keep your focus on the big picture when youre constantly faced with we could be out of business in a month well its just a very small percentage of mental energies on the on the big picture like you know you know you know where you generally heading for and the actual path is going to be some sort of zigzagging thing in that direction it try not to deviate too far from the path that you want to be on but youre going to have to do that some degree but I dont want to I dont want to diminish that I mean I think the product the profit motive is a is a good one if the rules of an industry are properly set up so its only fundamentally wrong with puppet in fact profit just means that people are paying you more for whatever youre doing then youre spending to create it thats a good thing and if youre not if thats not the case then youll be out of business and rightfully so youre not adding enough value now there are cases of course where people will do bad things in order to achieve profit but but thats actually quite unusual I mean because because usually the rules are set up mostly correctly like not completely with mostly correctly how do you spend your days enough like what what do you allocate most of your time to my time its mostly split between SpaceX and Tesla and of course I try to spend its a lot of every week at opening I basically half a day at opening I most weeks but other than that its really ideal when youre a little extra Tesla like what is your time look like there yeah its a good question I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on business new things but actually almost all my time 80 of it is spent on engineering design engineering and design so its developing the next generation product at thats 80 of it you probably not remember its a very long time ago many many years you took me on a tour of SpaceX and the most impressive thing was that you knew every detail of the rocket and every piece of engineering that went into it I dont think many people get that about you yeah I think a lot of people think Im kind of a business person or something it was fine I like Fitness is fine but a guy really you know if I get SpaceX Gwynne Shotwell is chief operating officer she kind of manages legal finance sales and kind of general business activity and then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team working on improving that the Falcon 9 and the Dragon spacecraft and developing the most colonial architecture and that Tesla its working on the model 3 and some in the design studio took a half a day a week dealing with aesthetics and and look and feel things and then most of our week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory how should someone figure out how they can be most useful whatever the things that youre trying to create what would what would be the utility Delta compared to the current stateoftheart times how many people it would affect so thats why I think having something that has thats that has a mix makes a big difference but effects a sort of small to moderate number of people is great as is something that makes even a small difference but it affects a vast number of people like the area yeah you know under the clothes yeah exactly the area under the curve is would actually be roughly similar for those two things I mean I think theres a lot of things I mean I sort of I mean certainly you know listen listen more to critical feedback I mean like a lot of things I learned in college actually are pretty helpful I mean the thankful physics approach to thinking is very good like the first principles approach and you applied that in broadly yeah applying the first principles approach to thinking is I think a good way to figure out the counterintuitive situations and I thought that I thought that I was that was really a helpful thing to learn whereas theres many things that need fixing in the world and students here probably to think of a long list many of which you could probably imagine solutions to using the physics first principle approach but has there been any framework or idea if youve used to filter out what you dont do what you dont pursue I mean would if sort of followed or what it initially was you know I wont go back to like college Santas working on energy storage technologies for electric vehicles and thats what I was going to pursue at Stanford actually with work work on like advanced capacitors and batteries to improve the energy density for electric vehicles and then the internet was kind of happening it was like the internet was happening like back in 94 95 and I wasnt sure if what I worked on in the PhD would actually be useful so I was like I was really concerned that if Id line timing or what was intuition meaning I think it could be academically useful but not practically useful like thank you you could result in a PhD and adding some leaf to the tree of knowledge but then then discovering that well its not really going to get a matter like thats is it is it going to be a good enough thing to actually be used in an electric vehicle I wasnt sure I mean so it was like I was uncertain as to whether success was one of the possible outcomes like I thought maybe it was but I wasnt sure and and then I thought well if I watch the internet get bill while Im doing this that that would be really frustrating theres a sense of that eminent tining like that was the time for the internet and maybe yeah it was tough could wait or be in the back was it always there is like one day Ill get back to that or was it thatll probably get back to it and did end up doing that a bit yeah absolutely the internet was happening it like really taking off all the most people werent aware a bit in 95 and and so I figured like electric vehicle technology energy storage technology will be some sort of natural progression in that and I could come back to it later but the internet you know it was really that was the moment to really do something although in 95 it wasnt obvious that you could actually make any money on the internet this was like no nobody until Netscape went public I think at the end of 95 at nobody even thought there was like you could make a valuable company on the Internet melodia says it seems now yes like now it seems really obvious but back then I was not at all and then the Internet is also helpful because its anything to do with software is a low capital endeavor so I didnt have any money I just had a bunch of students dad but but software you can just write like by yourself and you dont need a lot of atoms like you dont need a lot of tooling and equipment and such like capital intensive so the ability to start a company if its software related and its the first company is much much easier and it seems obvious now but of course the easier place to start and maybe a more of a personal reputation and had more personal capital as some Marianne I know SpaceX was ill but was entirely funded by Elon for its first period partially from you know in an era when others probably wouldnt have funded it right in those arrived two days oh and actually I mean before the precursor to to SpaceX was not the idea wasnt really to create a company it was it was to try to figure out why we hadnt gone ten people to Mars going from PayPal so the next thing I was sort of thinking well it is a some way to reignite the dream of Apollo that says you have a useful company so benign in a highgrowth scenario you have a lot more inputs for for future outputs so that you have negative cash flow and like a profitability and which we currently have a Tesla but in the long term of course that has to be that that has to be fixed they cant be negative cashflow and long term and that there needs to be a net positive output which is sort of profits in the long term but in the short term when theres high growth that that doesnt it isnt the most sensible thing when you have this thing that every employee and customer knows is the purpose of the company how do you see that flowing through to benefits for the company I think having a purpose suddenly is going to attract the very best talent in the world because if people can do something its intrinsically enjoyable and the branch rewards are good but then also its something thats going to genuinely change the world and thats I think thats pretty powerful motivator and but I dont think you like everything needs to change the world you know you know honestly like theres lots of like useful things that people do and I mean I think it really it should be like a usefulness optimization like just say like is what Im doing as useful as it could be you tamen through the goal of an organization well in general yeah and you know just even if something isnt changing the world that could make making peoples lives better I think thats thats great and you know if even if some things like making own people so its only slightly better but its a large number of people and kind like the area under the curve is is quite good and that mathematical first principle the point utility in number ugly yeah like I mean its sort of like the point its like so like its like some app really making peoples lives better fit specially but if its affecting a lot of people even in a small way then yeah these sort of area is good its always really tricky to predict the future alright some of its pretty obvious like computing power is going to be just crazy and really the big change is the cost of computing power hmm not so much the sort of circuit density so the Moores Law thing but if you if you look at say what is the actual dollars per instruction and and that that is dry I mean that that that cost is is dropping exponentially anything about it like you making a computer just youre rearranging silicon and copper you know so one on a little chip and once the capital cost of the development and the the chip plant is paid for the act I mean the module cost of a chip is very very tiny so I think well see massively parallel computers and kind computing power and storage being you know as really as much as you want it is interesting I to start with that like its like I dont know what else to predict but as a foundation were sure of this seems like the safest starting you know premise but then what is that ripple through to and feels like genetics in AI which you mentioned autonomous driving space related topics I mean just ubiquitous computing everywhere I like AI is going to be incredibly sophisticated in 20 years hmm the when the first it like it seems to be accelerating and that the tricky thing about predicting things when theres an exponential is that next potential looks like looks linear closed off and and its actually its not linear so and a I appears to be accelerating thats what I can see engine so that you look at autonomous driving and point a is like this theory like functionality as you have guideposts well I had sort of debate about someone like is AI accelerating or not and the key thing like you think well whats the yaxis you know if you different accelerating your T on the xaxis but whats what the yaxis as well thought about that I think you can have a recursive yaxis so that if at any point in time your predictions for AI are coming sooner or later that that actually would help to find whether its accelerating or not whatever that axis was so you magically get didnt ever immersive access like so if in any given year if you find your predictions are going further out or coming for the river coming closer ran that that actually you know it was one way to think of acceleration because like because otherwise whats the whats the quality verbal quantitative measure of AI and I can certainly see that with with autonomous driving you know three years ago I thought it was ten years away and at two years ago I thought it was five years away now I think its three years away or less than three years away Wow so any me say away like like like release the market available for consumer adoption is as opposed to prototyping no I mean like like the technology works theres a sort of second question as to when regulators would approve a yeah yeah yeah yeah but but like look at that technology works as a general solution so like Tron was driving like crisscross anywhere so it could be sooner for point things like highway only or in hi only were already in public beta with this Tesla so well be hopefully in the next several weeks releasing to to all of the cars that happen the autopilot hardware which is all car spoken like roughly the last 12 months and so for sure ubiquitous computing AI thats beyond anything like the public appreciated today I think will have most of the new vehicles being produced being electric and will be probably have the supermajority of energy being produced being sustainable so I think I think were on head of solar primarily in your mom early solar yeah I think that those are sort of some good things like I think will be and hopefully on a good path for sustainable energy sooner is always better but I think by 2035 I think will be substantially like what most of transport most of new energy being produced will be sustainable broadband everywhere broadband everywhere yeah and hopefully hopefully a small base on Mars or some school city on Mars in 20 years years Im gonna sit here well okay fine town village of you Hamlet I mean thats exciting I mean that could get people fired up about the teacher yeah I do I agree exactly I mean for sure for sure Mars and sustainable transport like those items I think are really very sustainable energy those are I think really cool things I mean in terms of getting excited about having needs I think well probably start seeing like more like truly sidewalk activity like human brain in like like the look range of your interfaces like theres a long side the AI is that are purely yeah yeah I think so the only way we can relate I think you know and have a conversation and there are amazing things happen like happening these days like this theyll be able to figure out how to do it auto fishel hippocampus in rats and monkeys and and now theyre looking at at doing that to solve severe epilepsy about half of severe epilepsy cases originating at so hippocampus by having sort of an artificially augmented hiccup hippocampus they can actually solve the severe epilepsy cases other board members asked and maybe they cheering up kind of method with some quoting Bill Gates or somebody that said you know if you havent failed and youre not learning or so thats a paraphrase of the clothes and I remember your reply and I have it written as a quote because I want to put it on a placard given the options I prefer to learn from success that me good I can come back and so I guess Alec series in general what do you think of the Silicon Valley mantra fail fast fail often or as Esther Dyson says always make new mistakes as well as if failure is the crucible of learning and experience if you have any further thoughts on that and that may be offthecuff comment you made out there I mean there are there are many bits or I mean I think its sort of just like some entropic basis but its like there are many walk more ways to fail than to succeed so you have to explore I mean take like for a rocket theres like a thousand ways to think and fail in like one way it can work so you could you could have a lot of rocket fires to explore all the ways in which you could fail if it but I didnt think that one great thing about looking at is failure is not a not a big stigma so its like if you if you try hard and it doesnt work out thats okay like you can learn from that and you know do another company and its not a big deal and thats really one of the great things about talk about it interesting do you also Im curious if either on the well it seems to me that on the system design side you can accommodate a likely failure of sub components and so much of the elegance of what they have Falcon nine or a  nine heavy at an ultimate incarnation of this vision of how the rocket should be built to say hey parts will fail thing but heres other system can succeed and Im curious if theres any other thoughts along that how to how to accommodate anticipated failure and then also maybe inner like in managerial II is there ways that you motivate the team either in advance of failure to coach them on it this is going to happen or in the aftermath of failure to get them fired up to solve it and move forward when it might be dark times and like for example you emotions like failure to launch you know exploding on the paddy know theres all these its a very visual its public spectacle when you have a setback in the rocket industry you can curious how you manage around failure I mean its I think its its like quite quite painful and difficult honestly and it feels terrible that the company is sort of looking to you know me to you know rally them and I do but honestly feel super bad like a punch in the gut yeah yeah remembers almost like a tight like the stages of grief I remember yeah I mean its just I mean its particularly with Rockets its just a really quite space is hard and rockets tend to fail unfortunately and even when youve got a lot of really smart people working super hard to minimize the probability of failure its still still there and its and its no its quite significant every lovasco nyquil wire wire rockets are especially hard and youre part of it is like everything has to work the first time like theres theres no you cant do a recall you cant patch it its like nine minutes to orbit or its over and and then the that you know what you cant you can never test the rocket completely in the environment that its actually going to experience you cant fully recreate something thats moving super fast in a vacuum on surface of a like you can only really record recreate that on in space so they limited the simulation tools all right is that a limit of the simulation tools today or that yeah absolutely other if theres any error between the simulation and reality and theres always so amount of error then then that that can result in failure its a really really tricky one its like in a software analogy it would be like if you had to write a whole bunch of software modules and you can never run them together and you can run them on the target computer look like when youre testing them youd have to test them individually and not in the actual computer that theyre going to run on gotcha then you put them put all the modules together run it for the first time in a completely different very different computer and it has to run with no bugs that is difficult the software analogies to rocket design are deep modular reuse I mean many of these like those who are in earth its not like this is an aerospace engineer by traditional training coming but but is in fact radically changing industry I think applying ACS perspective to industry after industry Im like how would how would you know computer scientist or a physicist approach the problem which oftentimes the solution very unlike the industry incumbents theres theres a certain elegance to it at least from the outside what do you look for in design and related if youd like what do you look for in art design might be more immediately there lord I mean you you want to make something beautiful you want to trigger whatever whatever fundamental aesthetic algorithms are like it in your brain you have I think some intrinsic elements that represent theory and and let that trigger the emotion of appreciation of beauty in your your mind and I think that these are these are actually relatively consistent among people I mean not completely so if you like not everyone likes the same thing but there are theres a lot of commonality and and there yeah and theyre worth it but but I think it is important to combine aesthetic design with functionality like if you say like what was really hard about the Model S or the Model X was to combine aesthetics and utility so to balance the two you can make a car look very good by giving it sort of certain proportions I keep making it sort of low and slim and if you if you do that the utility is significantly affected and so the big challenge with the set of Model S was trying to figure out how do we get five adults plus two kids because I wanna have from 17 a big challenge with the like with with es was having a car that had a high utility and look good and the same with the X so like its like with the tomato sports car look good is relatively easy but to make a sedan look good or an SUV look good its because quite difficult and I think another principle is you want to have it feel bigger on the inside then it looks on the outside and that thats also really hard thing to do and then you really pay attention to the little details the the nuances of design and shape and form function and the way it looks in different lights and when somethings off the little thing how do you experience that there drives me bananas yeah I mean it the problem is like if you you can train yourself to to pay attention to the tiny details I think almost anyone can although it this is a very much double edged sword because then you see although well be fit and then little things driving crazy so but like most people dont they dont see they dont consciously see the small details but they they do subconsciously see them like you sort of your mind takes in a result of the overall you know the overall impression and and you know if something is appealing or not even though you may not be able to point out exactly why and its its a summation of these many small details so most of us experience it as a way thats ugly or I think thats beautiful or like wow thats elegant but ya cant break it down you mentioned something in passing like you can train yourself in this though yeah you can train yourself I think you can make yourself pay attention to why you essentially bring the subconscious awareness into conscious awareness I wish I could do that how do you do that just Paik really close attention almost like a meditation on the object trying to find the details like why do I not like this is that what yeah look look closely and carefully mmhmm and if for any given object its that its geometry theres always something wrong somewhere all the time and so as long as people say super focused on creating an absolute best product or service that really delights their end customer if they stay focused on that then if your customers love you you will youre a success or a dramatically higher
