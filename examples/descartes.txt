Historical Note

Rene Descartes (1596-1650) published Discourse on Method in 1637.  The original work contained sections on optics, geometry, and meteorology.  The fourth section, the Discourse, outlined the basis for a new method of investigating knowledge.  He later (in 1641) published a more detailed exploration of the philosophical basis for this new approach to knowledge in Meditations on First Philosophy.

Descartes
Discourse on Method

            If this discourse seems too long to be read in a single sitting, it can be divided up into six parts. In the first will be found various considerations concerning the sciences; in the second, the principal rules of the method which the author has discovered; in the third, some rules of morality which he has derived by this method; in the fourth, the reasons which enable him to establish the existence of God and of the human soul, which are the foundations of his metaphysics; in the fifth part, the order of questions in physics which he has looked into, and particularly the explanation for the movements of the heart and for some other difficulties which are part of medicine, including the difference which exists between our souls and those of animals; in the last part, some matters he believes necessary for further research into nature, beyond where he has been, along with some reasons which have induced him to write.

Part One

            The most widely shared thing in the world is good sense, for everyone thinks he is so well provided with it that even those who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else do not usually desire to have more good sense than they have. In this matter it is not likely that everyone is wrong.  But this is rather a testimony to the fact that the power of judging well and distinguishing what is true from what is false, which is really what we call good sense or reason, is naturally equal in all men, and thus the diversity of our opinions does not arise because some people are more reasonable than others, but only because we conduct our thoughts by different routes and do not consider the same things. For it is not enough to have a good mind. The main thing is to apply it well. The greatest minds are capable of the greatest vices as well as the greatest virtues, and those who proceed only very slowly, if they always stay on the right road, are capable of advancing a great deal further than those who rush along and wander away from it.

            As for myself, I have never presumed that my mind was anything more perfect than the ordinary mind. I have often even wished that I could have thoughts as quick, an imagination as clear and distinct, or a memory as ample and actively involved as some other people. And I know of no qualities other than these which serve to perfect the mind. As far as reason, or sense, is concerned, given that it is the only thing which makes us human and distinguishes us from animals, I like to believe that it is entirely complete in each person, following in this the common opinion of philosophers, who say that differences of more and less should occur only between accidental characteristics and not at all between the forms or essential natures of individuals of the same species.

            But I am not afraid to state that since my youth I think I have been very fortunate to find myself on certain roads which have led me to considerations and maxims out of which I have created a method by which, it seems to me, I have a way of gradually increasing my knowledge, raising it little by little to the highest point which the mediocrity of my mind and the short length of my life can allow it to attain. For I have already harvested such fruit from this method that, even though, in judging myself, I always try to lean towards the side of distrust rather than to that of presumption and although, when I look with a philosopher's eye on the various actions and enterprises of all men, there are hardly any which do not seem to me vain and useless, I cannot help deriving extreme satisfaction from the progress which I think I have already made in my research into the truth and in conceiving such hopes for the future that, if among the occupations of men, simply as men, there is one which is surely good and important, I venture to think it's the one I have chosen.

            However, it could be the case that I am wrong and that perhaps what I have taken for gold and diamonds is only a little copper and glass. I know how much we are subject to making mistakes in what touches ourselves and also how much we should beware of the judgments of our friends when they favour us. But I will be only too happy to make known in this discourse what roads I have followed and to reveal my life, as if in a picture, so that each person can judge it. Learning from common talk the opinions people have of this discourse may be a new way of teaching me, something I will add to those which I habitually use.

            Thus, my design here is not to teach the method which everyone should follow in order to reason well, but only to reveal the ways in which I have tried to conduct my own reasoning. Those who take it upon themselves to give precepts must consider themselves more skilful than those to whom they give them, and if they are missing something, then they are culpable. But since I intend this text only as a history, or, if you prefer, a fable, in which, among some examples which you can imitate, you will, in addition, perhaps find several others which you will have reason not to follow, I hope that it will be useful to some people, without harming anyone, and that everyone will find my frankness agreeable.

            I was nourished on literature from the time of my childhood. Because people persuaded me that through literature one could acquire a clear and assured understanding of everything useful in life, I had an intense desire to take it up. But soon after I had completed that entire course of study at the end of which one was usually accepted into the rank of scholars, I changed my opinion completely. For I found myself embarrassed by so many doubts and errors that it seemed to me I had gained nothing by trying to instruct myself, other than the fact that I had increasingly discovered my own ignorance.

            Yet I had been in one of the most famous schools in Europe, a place where I thought there must be erudite men, if there were such people anywhere on earth. I had learned everything which the others had learned, but still, not being happy with the sciences which we had been taught, I had gone through all the books which I could lay my hands on dealing with those sciences which are considered the most curious and rare. In addition, I knew how other people were judging me, and I saw that they did not consider me inferior to my fellow students, although among them there were already some destined to fill the places of our teachers. And finally our age seemed to me as flourishing and as fertile in good minds as any preceding age. Hence, I took the liberty of judging all the others by myself and of thinking that there was no doctrine in the world of the kind I had previously been led to hope for.

            However, I did not cease valuing the exercises which kept people busy in the schools. I knew that the languages one learns there are necessary for an understanding of ancient books, that the gracefulness of fables awakens the intellect, that the memorable actions of history raise the mind, and if one reads with discretion, help to form one's judgment, that reading all the good books is like a conversation with the most honest people of past centuries, who were their authors, even a carefully prepared dialogue in which they reveal to us only the best of their thoughts, that eloquence has incomparable power and beauty, that poetry has a most ravishing delicacy and softness, that mathematics has very skilful inventions which can go a long way toward satisfying the curious as well as facilitating all the arts and lessening the work of men, that the writings which deal with morals contain several lessons and a number of exhortations to virtue which are extremely useful, that theology teaches one how to reach heaven, that philosophy provides a way of speaking plausibly on all matters and makes one admired of those who are less scholarly, that jurisprudence, medicine, and the other sciences bring honour and riches to those who cultivate them, and finally that it is good to have examined all of them, even the most superstitious and false, in order to know their legitimate value and to guard against being wrong.

            But I believed I had already given enough time to languages and even to reading ancient books as well, and to their histories and stories. For talking with those from other ages is the same as traveling. It is good to know something about the customs of various people, so that we can judge our own more sensibly and do not think everything different from our own ways ridiculous and irrational, as those who have seen nothing are accustomed to do. But when one spends too much time traveling, one finally becomes a stranger in one's own country, and when one is too curious about things which went on in past ages, one usually lives in considerable ignorance about what goes on in this one. In addition, fables make us imagine several totally impossible events as possible, and the most faithful histories, even if they neither change nor increase the importance of things to make them more worth reading, at the very least almost always omit the most menial and less admirable circumstances, with the result that what's left in does not depict the truth. Hence, those who regulate their habits by the examples which they derive from these histories are prone to fall into the extravagances of the knights of our romances and to dream up projects which surpass their powers.

            I placed a great value on eloquence, and I was in love with poetry, but I thought that both of them were gifts given to the mind rather than fruits of study. Those who have the most powerful reasoning and who direct their thoughts best in order to make them clear and intelligible can always convince us best of what they are proposing, even if they speak only the language of Lower Brittany and have never learned rhetoric. And those who possess the most pleasant rhetorical inventions and who know how to express them with the most adornment and smoothness cannot help being the best poets, even though the art of poetry is unknown to them.

            I found mathematics especially delightful because of the certainty and clarity of its reasoning. But I did not yet notice its true use. Thinking that it was practical only in the mechanical arts, I was astonished that on its foundations, so strong and solid, nothing more imposing had been built up. By contrast, I compared the writings of the ancient pagans which deal with morality to really superb and magnificent palaces built of nothing but sand on mud. They raise the virtues to a very great height and make them appear valuable, above everything in the world, but they do not teach us to know them well enough, and often what they teach with such a beautiful name is only insensibility or pride or despair or parricide.

            I revered our theology and aspired as much as anyone to reach heaven, but having learned, as something very certain, that the road there is no less open to the most ignorant as to the most learned and that the revealed truths which lead there are beyond our intelligence, I did not dare to submit them to the frailty of my reasoning, and I thought that undertaking to examine them successfully would require me to have some extraordinary heavenly assistance and to be more than a man.

            I will say nothing of philosophy other than this: once I saw that it had been cultivated for several centuries by the most excellent minds which had ever lived, and that, nonetheless, there was still nothing in it which was not disputed and which was thus not still in doubt, I did not have sufficient presumption to hope to fare better there than the others. Considering how many different opinions, maintained by learned people, philosophy could have about the same matter, without there ever being more than one which could be true, I reckoned as virtually false all those which were merely probable.

                        Then, as for the other sciences, since they borrow their principles from philosophy, I judged that nothing solid could have been built on such insubstantial foundations; and neither the honour nor the profit which they promise were sufficient to convince me to learn them; for, thank God, I did not feel myself in a condition which obliged me to make a profession of science in order improve my fortune, and, although I did not, in some cynical way, undertake to proclaim my disdain for glory, nonetheless I placed very little value on the glory I could hope to acquire only through false titles. And finally, as for bad doctrines, I thought I already understood sufficiently what they were worth in order not be taken in either by the promises of an alchemist, by the predictions of an astrologer, by the impostures of a magician, or by the artifice or the bragging of any of those who made a profession of knowing more than they know.

            That's why, as soon as my age permitted me to leave the supervision of my professors, I completely stopped the study of letters, and, resolving not to look any more in any other science except one which could be found inside myself or in the great book of the world, I spent the rest of my youth traveling, looking into courts and armies, associating with people of various humours and conditions, collecting various experiences, testing myself in the encounters which fortune offered me, and everywhere reflecting on the things I came across from which I could to draw some profit.

            For it seemed to me that I could arrive at considerably more truth in the reasoning that each man makes concerning the matters which are important to him and in which events could punish him soon afterwards if he judged badly, than in the reasoning made by a man of letters in his study concerning speculations which produce no effect and which are of no consequence to him, except perhaps that from them he can augment his vanity�and all the more so, the further his speculations are from common sense, because he would have had to use that much more wit and artifice in the attempt to make them probable. And I always had an extreme desire to learn to distinguish the true from the false, to see clearly in my actions, and to proceed with confidence in this life.

            It's true that while I did nothing but examine the customs of other men, I found hardly anything there to reassure me, and I noticed as much diversity among men as I had earlier among the opinions of philosophers. Consequently, the greatest profit which I derived from this was that, by seeing several things which, although they seem really extravagant and ridiculous to us, were commonly accepted and approved by other great people, I learned not to believe too firmly in anything which I had been persuaded to believe merely by example and by custom. Thus, I gradually freed myself of plenty of errors which can obfuscate our natural light and make us less capable of listening to reason. But after I had spent a few years studying in this way in the book of the world, attempting to acquire some experience, one day I resolved to study myself as well and to use all the powers of my mind to select ways which I should follow, a task which brought me considerably more success, it seems to me, than if I had never gone away from my own country and my books.

Part Two

            I was then in Germany, summoned there by the wars which have not yet concluded. As I was returning to the army from the coronation of the emperor, the onset of winter stopped me in quarters where, not finding any conversation to divert me and, by good fortune, not having any cares or passions to trouble me, I spent the entire day closed up alone in a room heated by a stove, where I had all the leisure to talk to myself about my thoughts. Among these, one of the first was that I noticed myself thinking about how often there is not so much perfection in works created from several pieces and made by the hands of various masters as there is in those which one person has worked on alone. Thus we see that the buildings which a single architect has undertaken and completed are usually more beautiful and better ordered than those several people have tried to refurbish by making use of old walls built for other purposes. That�s why those ancient cities which were only small villages at the start and became large towns over time are ordinarily so badly laid out, compared to the regular places which an engineer has designed freely on level ground. Even though, considering the buildings in each of them separately, we often find as much beauty in the former town as in the latter, or more, nonetheless, looking at them as they are arranged�here a large one, there a small one�and the way they make the streets crooked and unequal, we say that chance rather than the will of some men using their reason designed them this way.

            And if one considers that there have always been officials charged with seeing that private buildings serve as a public ornament, one will readily see that it is difficult to achieve really fine things by working only with other people's pieces. Thus, I imagined to myself that people who were semi-savages in earlier times and who became civilized only bit by bit and created their laws only as they were compelled to by the extent to which crimes and quarrels bothered them would not be so well regulated as those who, from the moment they first assembled, followed the constitution of some prudent legislator.

            It is indeed certain that the state of the true religion, whose laws God alone created, must be incomparably better ordered than all the others. And, to speak of human affairs, I believe that if Sparta was in earlier times very prosperous, that was not on account of the goodness of each of its laws in particular, seeing that several were very strange and even contrary to good morals, but on account of the fact that they were devised by only a single man and thus they contributed towards the same end. Similarly I thought that the knowledge contained in books, at least those whose reasons are only probable and without any proofs, was put together and crudely fashioned little by little out of the opinions of several different people and thus did not approach the truth as much as the simple reasoning which a man of good sense can make quite naturally concerning matters of his own experience. In the same way I thought that because we were all children before we were men and because it was necessary for us to be governed for a long time by our appetites and our supervisors, who were often at odds with each other, with neither of them perhaps advising us always for the best, it is almost impossible that our judgments are as pure and solid as they would have been if we had had the total use of our reason from the moment of our birth and had never been led by anything but our reason.

            It is true that we see little point in demolishing all the houses of a city for the sole purpose of rebuilding them in another way to make the streets more beautiful. But we do see several people demolish their houses in order to rebuild them, and, indeed, sometimes they are compelled to do so, when the houses are in danger of collapsing on their own and when their foundations are not steady. This example persuaded me that there would probably be little point for a particular man to draw up a design for reforming a state, changing all of it from the foundations, overturning it in order to put it up again, or even for reforming the body of sciences or the order established in the schools for teaching the sciences. But so far as all the opinions which I had received up to that point and which I believed credible were concerned, I convinced myself that the best possible thing for me to do was to undertake to remove them once and for all, so that afterwards I could replace them either by other better ones or perhaps by the same ones, once I had adjusted them to a reasonable standard.

            And I firmly believed that by this means I would be successful in conducting my life better than if I built only on the old foundations and relied only on principles which I had been persuaded to accept in my youth, without having examined whether they were true. For, although I recognized various problems with this approach, these were not without remedy and could not compare to those which occur in the reforms of the least matters concerning the public. It is too difficult to re-erect those large bodies if they are thrown down or even to keep them once they are weakened, and their collapses cannot be anything but very drastic.

            Then, as far as the imperfections of large public bodies are concerned, if they have any (and the variety among such bodies alone is sufficient to assure us that there are several imperfections), habit has no doubt considerably softened these and has even managed to avoid some problems or corrected a number of them insensibly, which people's caution could not have managed so well, and finally the imperfections are almost always easier to bear than changing them would be, in the same way that the major roads which wind among the mountains gradually become so smooth and convenient from being used, that it is much better to follow them than to set out to go more directly by climbing up over the rocks and right to the bottom of the precipices.

            That's why I cannot approve at all of those muddled and worried temperaments who, without being summoned by their birth or fortune to the management of public business, never stop proposing some idea for a new reform in it. If I thought that there was the slightest thing in this text which would enable someone to suspect me of this foolishness, I would be very reluctant to allow it to be published. My intention has never been to do more than try to reform my own thoughts and to build on a foundation which is entirely my own. And if my work has pleased me sufficiently to make me show you the model of it here, that's not because I wish to advise anyone to imitate it. Those to whom God has given more of his grace will perhaps have loftier intentions, but I fear that this work may already be too bold for several people. The single resolution to strip away all the opinions which one has previously absorbed into one's beliefs is not an example which everyone should follow.

            Most of the world is made up of two sorts of minds for whom such a resolution is not suitable. First, there are those who, believing themselves more clever than they are, cannot stop making hasty judgments, without having enough patience to conduct their thoughts in an orderly way, with the result that, once they have taken the liberty of doubting the principles they have received and of leaving the common road, they will never be able to hold to the track which they need to take in order to proceed more directly and will remain lost all their lives. Then, there are the ones who, having sufficient reason or modesty to judge that they are less capable of differentiating truth and falsehood than several others from whom they can be instructed, must content themselves with following the opinions of these others rather than searching for better opinions on their own.

            As for me, I would have undoubtedly been among the number of this latter group if I had only had a single master or if I had known nothing at all about the differences which have always existed among the opinions of the scholarly. But I learned from my college days on that one cannot imagine anything so strange and so incredible that it has not been said by some philosopher and, later, in my traveling, I learned that those who have views very different from our own are not therefore barbarians or savages, but that several use as much reason as we do, or more. I also considered how much the same man, with the same mind, raised from his infancy on among the French or the Germans, would become different from what he would have been if he had always lived among the Chinese or the cannibals, and how, even in our style of dress the same thing which pleased us ten years ago and which will perhaps please us again ten years from today, now seems to us extravagant and ridiculous. This being the case, we are clearly persuaded more by custom and example than by any certain knowledge. Nonetheless, a plurality of voices is not a proof worth anything for truths which are a little difficult to discover, because it is far more probable that one man by himself would have found them than an entire people. Since I could not select anyone whose opinions it seemed to me preferable to those of other people, I found myself, so to speak, compelled to guide myself on my own.

            But like a man who proceeds alone and in the shadows, I resolved to go so slowly and to use so much circumspection in all matters, that if I only advanced a very short distance, at least I would take good care not to fall. I did not even wish to begin by rejecting completely any of the opinions which could have slipped into my beliefs previously without being introduced by reason, before I had taken up enough time drawing up a plan for the work I was undertaking and seeking out the best method for arriving at an understanding of everything my mind was capable of knowing.

            When I was younger, among the branches of philosophy, I had studied a little logic and, among the subjects of mathematics, geometrical analysis and algebra, three arts or sciences which looked as if they ought to contribute something to my project. But in looking at them, I took care, because, so far as logic is concerned, its syllogisms and most of its other instructions serve to explain to others what one already knows or even, as in the art of Lully*, to speak without judgment of things about which one is ignorant, rather than to learn what they are. Although philosophy does, in fact, contain many really true and excellent precepts, mixed in with them there are always so many injurious or superfluous ones that it is almost as difficult to separate them as to draw a Diana or a Minerva out of a block of marble which has not yet been carved.

            Then, so far as the analysis of the ancients and the algebra of the moderns are concerned, other than the fact that they deal only with really abstract matters, which have no apparent use, the first is always so concentrated on considering numbers that it cannot exercise the understanding without considerably tiring the imagination, and in the latter one is so subject to certain rules and symbols that it has been turned into a confused and obscure art which clutters up the mind rather than a science which cultivates it.

            Those are the reasons why I thought I had to look for some other method which included the advantages of these three subjects but was free of their defects. And since a multitude of laws often provides excuses for vices, so that a state is much better ruled when it has only a very few laws which are very strictly observed, I thought that, instead of that large number of rules which make up logic, I would have enough with the four following rules, provided that I maintained a strong and constant resolution that I would never fail to observe them, not even once.

            The first rule was that I would not accept anything as true which I did not clearly know to be true. That is to say, I would carefully avoid being over hasty or prejudiced, and I would understand nothing by my judgments beyond what presented itself so clearly and distinctly to my mind that I had no occasion to doubt it.

            The second was to divide each difficulty which I examined into as many parts as possible and as might be necessary to resolve it better.

            The third was to conduct my thoughts in an orderly way, beginning with the simplest objects, the ones easiest to know, so that little by little I could gradually climb right up to the knowledge of the most complex, by assuming the same order, even among those things which do not naturally come one after the other.

            And the last was to make my calculations throughout so complete and my examinations so general that I would be confident of not omitting anything.

            Those long chains of reasons, all simple and easy, which geometers have habitually used to reach the most difficult proofs gave me occasion to imagine to myself that everything which could fall under human knowledge would follow in the same way and that, provided only that one refused to accept anything as true which was not and that one always kept to the order necessary to deduce one thing from another, there would not be anything so far distant that one could not finally reach it, nor so hidden that one could not discover it.

            And I did not have much trouble finding out the issues which I had to deal with first. For I already knew that it had to be with the simplest things, the ones easiest to know. When I thought about how, among all those who had so far searched for truth in the sciences, it was only the mathematicians who had been able to find some proofs, that is to say, some certain and evident reasons, I had no doubt at all that I should start with the same things which they had examined, although I did not hope for any practical results, other than that they would accustom my mind to revelling in the truth and not to remain happy with false reasons. But for all that I did not plan trying to learn all the particular sciences which people commonly call mathematical. Since I saw that, even though their objects were different, they all were alike in that they all agreed they should consider nothing except the various relationships or proportions among the objects of study found there, I thought that it would be more valuable if I examined only these proportions in general, assuming only that they were present in the subjects which would help to provide me knowledge of them most readily, but without in this way restricting them at all, so that they could be all the better applied later to every other subject for which they might be suitable.

            Then, because I observed that, in order to understand these things, I would sometimes need to consider each one in particular and sometimes only to remember them or to understand several of them together, I thought that to consider them better separately, I ought to assume that they were like lines, because I know of nothing simpler, nothing which I could more distinctly represent to my imagination and my senses. But in order to remember them or to understand several of them together, I had to explain them by some formulas as short as possible and, by this means, I would borrow all the best elements of analytic geometry and algebra and correct all the defects of one by the other.

            As a matter of fact, I venture to say that the precise observation of these few precepts which I had selected gave me such a facility at disentangling all the questions which these sciences cover, that in the two or three months that I used them to examine these questions, starting with the simplest and the most general, letting each truth I found serve as a rule which I could use afterwards to find others, not only did I resolve several problems which I had previously judged very difficult, but it also seemed to me towards the end that I could determine, even with those questions where I was ignorant, the way to resolve them and the extent to which such resolution was possible. In saying this, perhaps I will not appear too vain if you consider that, since there is only one truth for each thing, whoever finds it knows as much as one can know about it and that, for example, a child instructed in arithmetic, having made an addition following the rules, can be confident of having found, so far as the sum he is examining is concerned, everything that the human mind can find out. For the method which teaches one to follow the true order and to count exactly all the relevant details in what one is looking for contains everything which gives certainty to the rules of arithmetic.

            But what pleased me the most with this method was that with it I was confident of using all my reason, if not perfectly, at least as well as was in my power. In addition, I felt, as I applied it, that my mind was accustoming itself gradually to think more clearly and distinctly about its objects, and because I had not restricted this method to one matter in particular, I was hopeful that I could apply it just as usefully to difficulties in the other sciences as I had applied it to those in algebra.

            But for all that, I did not venture to try immediately examining all those scientific problems which presented themselves. For that would have been contrary to the order which my method prescribed. But I noticed that the principles of science all had to be borrowed from philosophy, a subject in which I no longer found anything certain. So I thought that, before anything else, I should attempt to establish such principles and that, since this was the most important matter in the world, where one had to be most fearful of over-hasty and biased judgments, I would not try to get through it until I had reached an age considerably more mature than I was then at twenty-three and until I had used a lot more time preparing myself, weeding out of my mind all the bad opinions which I had accepted before that time, as well as collecting experiences which later could be the subject matter of my reasoning, always practising the method which I had set for myself in order to keep improving myself in these matters.


Part Three

            Finally, before one starts to rebuild the lodgings where one lives, it is not sufficient to knock them down and provide for materials and architects or to work on the architecture oneself, having, in addition to that, carefully drawn up a design. One must also provide oneself with some other place where one can lodge comfortably during the time one works on the building. Thus, in order not to be irresolute in my actions while my reason obliged me to be so in my judgments and in order to be able to live from then on as happily as I could, I drew up for myself a provisional morality, consisting of only three or four maxims, which I wish to share with you.

            The first was to obey the laws and the customs of my country, constantly holding to the religion which God gave me the grace to be instructed in since my childhood and governing myself in all other things in accordance with the most moderate opinions, the ones furthest removed from excess, which were commonly accepted and practised by the most sensible of those people among whom I was living. Since, from that point on, I began to estimate my own views as worthless, because I wished to subject them all to examination, I was confident that I could not do better than to follow those of the most sensible people.

            And even though there might perhaps be people just as sensible among the Persians or the Chinese as among us, it seemed to me that the most practical thing would be for me to guide myself by those among whom I had to live and that, in order to understand their real opinions, it would be better for me to pay attention to what they practised rather than to what they said, not only because, given the corruption of our morals, there are few people who are willing to say what they believe, but also because several are themselves ignorant of what they believe. For the act of thinking by which one believes in something is different from the act of thinking by which one understands that one believes it, and one of these separate acts frequently appears without the other.

            Moreover, among several opinions equally well received, I chose only the most moderate ones, as much because such opinions are always the most convenient to practice and probably the best, for all excess is usually bad, as because they would be less likely to turn me away from the true road, if I fell short, than if I had chosen one of the extremes when it was the other one which I should have followed.

            And I especially included among what was excessive all promises by which one reduces one's liberty. Not that I disapprove of laws which, in an attempt to remedy the fickleness of feeble minds, permit people with a good plan or even an indifferent arrangement for security in business to make vows or contracts obliging them to maintain their provisions. But because I didn't see anything in the world which remained always in the same condition and, in my particular case, because I promised myself that I would increasingly perfect my judgments and not make them worse, I would have thought I was committing a great error in good sense if, because I then approved of something, I obliged myself to continue to take it as something good later on, when it had perhaps ceased to be so or when I had ceased to value it as something good.

            My second maxim was to be as constant and as resolute in my actions as I could, and to follow the most doubtful opinions, once I had settled on them for myself, with no less constancy than if they had been very sure, imitating in this matter travelers who, finding themselves lost in some forest, should not wander around, shifting direction this way and that; even less should they stop in one place; they should move on always as straight as they can in the same direction and not change it for inadequate reasons, even though at the beginning it was perhaps only chance which led to their choice of direction. For in this way, if they do not come out exactly where they want to, they will at least end up arriving somewhere where they will probably be better off than in the middle of a forest.

            And because the actions of life often brook no delay, it is certainly true that, when it is not in our power to determine the truest opinions, we ought to follow the most probable ones, and even when we see no difference in probability among this group of truths or that one, nevertheless, we have to decide on some for ourselves and then to consider them, not as something doubtful with regard to the practical matter at hand, but as manifestly true and very certain, because the reason which made us choose them has these qualities. This method was able from then on to relieve me of all the regrets and remorse which usually upset the consciences of those weak and wavering minds which permit themselves to work unevenly with things which they accept as good but which they later judge to be bad.

            My third maxim was to try always to overcome myself rather than fortune and to change my desires rather than the order of the world, and generally to get in the habit of believing that there is nothing which is entirely within our power except our thoughts, so that after we have done our best concerning those things which lie outside of us, everything which our attempt fails to deal with is, so far as we are concerned, absolutely impossible.

            That alone seemed to me to be sufficient to prevent me from desiring anything in future which I could not achieve and thus to make me happy. For since our will has a natural tendency to desire only things which our understanding represents as in some way possible, it is certain that if we think about all the good things which are outside of us as equally distant from our power, we would no more regret missing those whose loss is due to our birth, when we are deprived by no fault of our own, than we would regret not possessing the kingdoms of China or Mexico. By making, as the saying goes, a virtue of necessity, we would not desire health when we are sick or freedom when we are in prison, any more than we now desire to have either a body made of some material less subject to decay than diamonds or wings to fly, like the birds.

            But I admit that there is a need for a long discipline and frequently repeated meditation in order to accustom oneself to looking at everything from this point of view. And I believe that this is the principal secret of those philosophers who have been able in earlier times to escape from the demands of empire and fortune and who, despite pains and poverty, could rival their gods in happiness. For, constantly busy thinking about the limits prescribed for them by nature, they persuaded themselves so perfectly that nothing was in their power except their thoughts, that that alone would be enough to prevent them from having any affection for other things, and they acquired such an absolute control over their thoughts that they found in that process reason to think themselves more rich and more powerful and more free and more happy than any other men, who, because they did not possess this philosophy, never had the same control over everything they desired, no matter how favoured they might be by nature and fortune.

            Finally, to conclude these moral precepts, I advised myself to draw up a review of the various occupations which men have in this life, in an attempt to make a choice about the best and, without wanting to say anything about the others, I thought that I could not do better than to continue in the very occupation I was engaged in, that is, using all my life to cultivate my reason and to progress as far as I could in a knowledge of the truth, following the method which I had prescribed for myself. I experienced such extreme contentment once I started using this method that I did not think that one could find anything more sweet and innocent. Since every day I discovered through this method some truths which seemed to me sufficiently important and commonly unknown to other men, the satisfaction I got so filled my mind that nothing else affected me.

            Moreover, the three maxims mentioned above were founded only for the plan I had to continue my self-instruction. For since God has given each one of us some light to distinguish truth from falsehood, I would not have thought I could remain content with other people's opinions for one moment, if I had not set out to use my own judgment to examine them when the time was right, and I would not have known how to free myself from scruples in following these opinions, if I had not hoped that I would not, in the process, lose any opportunity to find better ones, in cases where these existed. Finally I would not have known how to limit my desires nor how to rest content, if I had not followed a road by which I believed I could be confident of acquiring all the knowledge I was capable of. I thought by the same means I could acquire all the true benefits I was capable of obtaining, all the more so since our will tends to follow or to fly away from only those things which our understanding has represented to it as good or bad. So in order to act well it is sufficient to judge well, and to judge as well as one can is sufficient to enable one to do one's best, that is, to acquire all the virtues, along with all the other benefits which one can get, and when one is certain that that is the case one could not fail to be happy.

            After assuring myself of these maxims in this manner and storing them away, along with the truths of the faith, which have always been first in my beliefs, I judged that, so far as all the rest of my opinions were concerned, I could freely set about dispensing with them. Since I hoped to be able to arrive at my goal more easily by talking with men rather than staying any longer closed up in the room with the stove where I had had all these thoughts, before that winter was over and done with, I set about my travels again.

            And in all the nine years following I did nothing else but roll around here and there in the world, trying to be a spectator rather than an actor in all the comedies playing themselves out. By reflecting on each matter, in particular on what there was which could render it suspect and give us an opportunity to make mistakes, I rooted out from my mind all the errors which could have slid into it in the previous years. Not that in the process I copied the sceptics, who doubt only for the sake of doubting, and pretend that they are always irresolute. For my entire plan, by contrast, tended only to make me confident about throwing away the shifting ground and the sand, in order to find the rock or the sedimentary clay.

            This gave me considerable success, it seems to me, inasmuch as in my attempts to discover the falsity or the uncertainty of the propositions I examined, not by weak conjectures, but by clear and confident reasoning, I came across nothing so doubtful that I did not always draw some fairly certain conclusion from it, even if that conclusion was that it contained nothing certain. Just as when we tear down an old lodging, we usually keep the scrap to use in building a new structure, so, as I destroyed all those opinions of mine which I judged poorly grounded, I made various observations and acquired several experiences which were of use to me later in establishing more certain ones.

            In addition, I continued to practice the method which I had set for myself. For apart from the fact that I took care, in general, to conduct all my thinking according to the rules, from time to time I set aside a few hours which I used to apply the method to mathematical difficulties in particular, or even to some other difficulties as well, ones which I could frame in a manner somewhat similar to those in mathematics, stripping from them all the principles of the other sciences which I did not find sufficiently strong, as you will see I have done in the several which are explained in this volume.*

            Thus, without living in a way apparently different from those who have nothing else to do but spend a sweet and innocent life studying how to separate pleasures from vices and enjoying their leisure by making use of all honest entertainments without getting bored, I did not fail to follow my plans and to benefit from the knowledge of the truth, perhaps more so than if I had only read books or associated with men of letters.

            However, these nine years passed by before I had yet taken any stand concerning the difficulties which are usually matters of dispute among the scholars. Nor had I started to seek the foundations of any philosophy more reliable than common philosophy. The example of several excellent minds who had earlier had the same idea but who, it seemed to me, had not succeeded, made me imagine such great difficulties that I would perhaps not have ventured to undertake it so quickly, if I had not seen that some people had already spread the rumour that I had concluded my work. I don't know what to say about the basis for this rumour. And if I contributed something to it by my conversations, that could have been by confessing where I was ignorant more ingenuously than those who have studied little are accustomed to do and perhaps also by making known the reasons I had to doubt many things which other people considered certain, rather than by boasting about any doctrine.

            But having a heart sufficiently good not to wish people to take me for someone other than the man I am, I thought it necessary to attempt by every means to make myself worthy of the reputation which people ascribed to me. For exactly eight years this desire made me resolve to distance myself from all those places where there might be people I know and to retire here, in a country where the long duration of the war has established such order that the armies which maintain it appear to serve only to enable the people to enjoy the fruits of peace with even more security and where, among the crowd of a great and very active people, who are more careful about their own affairs than curious about those of other people, with no lack of any commodities present in more frequently visited towns, I was able to live retired in solitude, just as if I were in the most isolated deserts.

 

Part Four

            I don't know if I should share with you the first meditations which I made there, for they are so metaphysical and so out of the ordinary that they will perhaps not be to everyone's taste. However, in order that people may be able to judge if the foundations which I set are sufficiently strong, I find myself in some way compelled to speak of them. For a long time previously I had noticed that where morals are concerned it is necessary sometimes to follow opinions which one knows are extremely uncertain as if they are indubitable, as mentioned above. But since at that time I wanted only to carry out research into the truth, I thought I must do the opposite and reject as absolutely false everything about which I could imagine the least doubt, in order to see if there would be anything totally indisputable remaining after that in my belief.

            Thus, because our senses deceive us sometimes, I was willing to assume that there was nothing which existed the way our senses present it to us. And because there are men who make mistakes in reasoning, even concerning the most simple matters of geometry, and who create para-logisms, and because I judged that I was subject to error just as much as anyone else, I rejected as false all the reasons which I had taken earlier as proofs. Finally, considering that all the same thoughts which we have when awake can also come to us when we are asleep, without there being truth in any of them at the time, I determined to pretend that everything which had ever entered my mind was no more true than the illusions of my dreams.

            But immediately afterwards I noticed that, while I wished in this way to think everything was false, it was necessary that I�who was doing the thinking�had to be something. Noticing that this truth�I think; therefore, I am�was so firm and so sure that all the most extravagant assumptions of the sceptics would not be able to weaken it, I judged that I could accept it without scruple as the first principle of the philosophy I was looking for.

            Then I examined with attention what I was, and I saw that I could pretend that I had no body and that the world and the place where I was did not exist, but that, in spite of this, I could not pretend that I did not exist. By contrast, in the very act of thinking about doubting the truth of other things, it very clearly and certainly followed that I existed; whereas, if I had once stopped thinking, even though all the other things which I had imagined were real, I would have no reason to believe that I existed. From that I recognized that I was a substance whose essence or nature is only thinking, a substance which had no need of any location and did not depend on any material thing, so that this �I,� that is to say, the soul, by which I am what I am, is entirely distinct from the body and is even easier to know than the body, and that, even if the body were no longer there, the soul could not help being everything it is.

            After that, I considered in general what is necessary for a proposition to be true and certain, for since I had just found one idea which I knew to be true and certain, I thought that I ought also to understand what this certitude consisted of. And having noticed that in the sentence "I think; therefore, I am" there is nothing at all to assure me that I am speaking the truth, other than that I see very clearly that in order to think it is necessary to exist, I judged that I could take as a general rule the point that the things which we conceive very clearly and very distinctly are all true. But that left the single difficulty of properly noticing which things are the ones we conceive distinctly.

            After that, I reflected on the fact that I had doubts and that, as a result, my being was not completely perfect, for I saw clearly that it was a greater perfection to know than to doubt. I realized that I should seek out where I had learned to think of something more perfect than I was. And I concluded that obviously this must be something with a nature which was, in effect, more perfect.

            As for the thoughts which I had of several other things outside of me, like the sky, the earth, light, heat, and a thousand others, I was not worried about knowing where they came from, because I didn't notice anything in them which seemed to me to make them superior to myself. Thus, I was able to think that, if they were true, that was because of their dependence on my nature, in so far as they had some perfection and, if they were not true, I held them from nothing, that is to say, that they were in me because I had some defect.

            But that could not be the same with the idea of a being more perfect than mine. For to hold that idea from nothing would be manifestly impossible. And because it is no less unacceptable that something more perfect should be a consequence of and dependent on something less perfect than that something should come from nothing, I could not derive this idea from myself. Thus, I concluded that the idea had been put in me by a nature which was truly more perfect than I was, even one which contained in itself all the perfections about which I could have some idea, that is to say, to explain myself in a single phrase, a nature which was God.

            To this I added the fact that, since I know about some perfections which I do not have, I was not the only being which existed (here I will freely use, if you will permit me, the language of the schools). But it must of necessity be the case that there was some other more perfect being, on whom I depended and from whom I had acquired all that I had. For if I had been alone and independent of everything else, so that I derived every idea, however little, which I shared of the perfect being from myself, I would have been able to have from myself, for the same reason, all the additional perfections which I knew I lacked, and thus be myself infinite, eternal, immutable, all knowing, all powerful, and finally have all the perfections which I could observe as present in God.

            For, following the reasoning which I have just made, to know the nature of God, to the extent that my reasoning is able to do that, I only had to think about of all the things of which I had some idea within me and consider whether it was a sign of perfection to possess them or not. And I was confident that none of those ideas which indicated some imperfection were in God, but that all the others were there, since I perceived that doubt, inconstancy, sadness, and similar things could not be in God, in view of the fact that I myself would have been very pleased to be free of them.

            Then, in addition, I had ideas about several sensible and corporeal things. For although I supposed that I was asleep and that everything which I saw or imagined was false, nonetheless I could not deny that the ideas had truly been in my thoughts. But because I had already recognized in me very clearly that intelligent nature is distinct from corporeal nature, when I considered that all composite natures indicate dependency and that dependency is manifestly a defect, I judged from this that God's perfection could not consist of being composed of two natures, and that thus He was not, but that if there were some bodies in the world or even some intelligences or other natures which were not completely perfect, their being had to depend on God's power, in such a way as they could not subsist for a single moment without Him.

            After that I wanted to look for other truths, and I proposed to myself the subject matter of geometricians, which I understood as a continuous body or a space extended indefinitely in length, width, and height or depth, divisible into various parts, which could have various figures and sizes and be moved or transposed in all sorts of ways, for the geometricians assume all that in their subject matter. I glanced through some of their simplest proofs, and having observed that this grand certainty which all the world attributes to them is founded only on the fact that they plan these proofs clearly, following the rule which I have so often stated, I notice also that there is nothing at all in their proofs which assures me of the existence of their objects. So, for example, I do see that, if we assume a triangle, it must the case that its three angles are equal to two right angles, but, in spite of that, I don't see anything which assures me that there is a triangle in the world. But, by contrast, once I returned to an examination of the idea which I had of a perfect being, I found that that being contains the idea of existence in the same way as the fact the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles is contained in the idea of a triangle, or that in a sphere all the parts are equidistant from the centre, or something even more evident, and that, as a result, it is at just as certain that God, this perfect being, is or exists as any geometric proof can be.

            But the reason there are several people who persuade themselves that there are difficulties in understanding this and even knowing what their soul is, as well, is that they never raise their minds above matters of sense experience and that they are so accustomed not to consider anything except by imagining it, which is a way of thinking in particular of material things, so that everything which is not imaginable seems to them unintelligible. This point is obvious enough in the fact that even the philosophers in the schools maintain the axiom that there is nothing in the understanding which has not first of all been in the senses. But it is certain that the ideas of God and the soul have never been present in sense experience. It seemed to me that those who want to use their imagination to understand these things are acting just as if they want to use their eyes to hear sounds or smell odours, except that there is still this difference, that the sense of sight provides us no less assurance of the truth of what it sees than do the sense of smell or hearing; whereas, neither our imagination nor our senses can assure us of anything unless our understanding intercedes.

            Finally, if there are still some people who are insufficiently persuaded of the existence of God and their soul by the reasons I have provided, I'd like them to know that everything else which they perhaps are more confident about in their thinking, like having a body and knowing that there are stars and an earth, and things like that, are less certain than God's existence. For although one has a moral assurance about these things, something which makes doubting them appear at least extravagant, nonetheless it also seems at least unreasonable, when a question of metaphysical certainty is involved, for someone to deny that there is sufficient material here to make one not completely confident, for we notice that one can imagine in the same way while sleeping that one has a body and that one sees other stars and another earth, without such things existing.

            For what is the source of our knowledge that the thoughts which come while dreaming are false, rather than the others, seeing that often they are no less lively and distinct? And if the best minds study this matter as much as they please, I do not think that they will be able to give any reason which will be sufficient to remove this doubt unless they presuppose the existence of God. First of all, the very principle which I have so often taken as a rule�only to recognize as true all those things which we conceive very clearly and very distinctly�is guaranteed only because of the fact that God is or exists, that He is a perfect being, and that everything which is in us comes from Him. From that it follows that our ideas or notions, being real things which come from God, to the extent that they are clear and distinct, in that respect cannot be anything but true. Consequently, if we often enough have some ideas or notions which contain something false, that can only be those which contain some confusion and obscurity, because in this they participate in nothing, that is to say, they are so confused in us only because we are not completely perfect.

            And evidently it is no less repugnant that falsity or imperfection, in itself, should come from God than that utility or truth should come from nothingness. But if we did not know that everything real and true within us came from a perfect and infinite being, then no matter how clear and distinct our ideas were, we would not have a single reason to assure us that they had the perfection of being true.

            Now, after the knowledge of God and the soul in this way has made us certain of this rule, it is really easy to see that the dreams which we imagine while asleep should not, in any way, make us doubt the truth of the thoughts we have while awake. For if it happened, even while we were sleeping, that we had some really distinct idea, as, for example, in the case of a geometer inventing some new proof, the fact that he is asleep does not prevent it from being true, and as for error, it doesn't matter that the most common dreams we have, which consist of representing to us various objects in the same way as our external senses do, can give us occasion to challenge the truth of such ideas, because these ideas can also mislead us often enough without our being asleep, as, for example, when those people suffering from jaundice see all objects as yellow, or when the stars or other bodies at a great distant appear to us much smaller than they are.

            For, finally, whether we are awake or asleep, we should never allow ourselves to be persuaded except by the evidence of our reason. And people should note that I say of our reason and not of our imagination or of our senses, since even though we see the sun very clearly, we should not for that reason judge that it is only the size which we see, and we can easily imagine distinctly the head of a lion mounted on the body of goat, without having to conclude, because of that, there is a chimera in the world*: for reason does not dictate to us that what we see or imagine in this way is true, but it does dictate to us that all our ideas or notions must have some foundation in truth, for it would not be possible that God, who is completely perfect and totally truthful, put them in us without that. Because our reasoning is never so evident or complete during sleeping as while we are awake, although then sometimes our imaginations are as vital or explicit, or more so, reason also dictates to us that our ideas cannot all be true, because we are not completely perfect�those which contain the truth must without exception come in those we experience while awake rather than in those we have while asleep.

 

Part Five

            I would be very pleased to continue and make you see here all the chain of other truths which I deduced from these first ones. But because that would require that I talked of several questions which are controversial among scholars, things I do not want to get mixed up with, I think it would be better to refrain from that and speak only in general about what these matters are, so that the more learned can judge if it would be useful for the public to be informed about more particular details.

            I always lived firm in the resolution that I had taken not to assume any other principle than the one which I have just used to demonstrate the existence of God and the soul, and to accept nothing as true which did not seem to me more clear and more certain than the proofs of geometry had seemed to me previously. Nonetheless, I venture to say that, not only did I find a way of satisfying myself in a short time concerning all the difficult principles which people are accustomed to deal with in philosophy, but also I noticed certain laws which God has established in nature. Since He has imprinted ideas of these laws in our souls, after we have reflected on them sufficiently, we cannot doubt that they are precisely observed in everything which exists or which acts in the world. Then, as I considered the consequence of these laws, it seemed to me that I had discovered several truths more useful and more important than everything which I had previously learned or even hoped to learn.

            But since I attempted to explain the principles in a treatise which certain considerations prevented me from publishing, I do not know how better to make them known than stating here in summary form what that treatise contains. Before writing that text, I had the intention of including in it all that I thought I knew concerning the nature of material things. But just as painters cannot portray equally well in a flat picture all the various surfaces of a solid body and choose one of the main surfaces, which they set by itself facing the light and, by placing the others in shadows, do not show anything more than one can see by looking at them, in the same way, fearing that I could not put in my discourse everything I had in my thoughts, I tried only to reveal there fairly fully what I understood about light, and then at the appropriate time, to add something about the sun and the fixed stars, because almost all light comes from them, about the heavens, because they transmit light; about the planets, comets, and the earth, because they reflect light, and in particular about all the bodies on earth, because they are coloured, or transparent, or luminous, and finally about man, because he is the one who looks at these things.

            Even so, in order to shade in all these things a little and to be able to speak more freely of what I was judging, without being obliged to follow or to refute received opinions among the learned, I resolved to leave everyone here to their disputes and to speak only of what would happen in a new world, if God now created somewhere in imaginary space enough material to compose it, and if He set in motion, in a varied and disorderly way, the various parts of this material, so that it created a chaos as confused as poets could make it, and then afterwards He did nothing other than lend His ordinary help to nature and allow it to act according to the laws which He established.

            So first of all I described this material and tried to picture it in such a way that there is nothing in the world, it seems to me, clearer and more intelligible, except what has been said from time to time about God and the soul. For I even explicitly assumed that in the world there were none of those forms or qualities which people argue about in the schools, nor, in general, anything the knowledge of which was not so natural to our souls that we could not even pretend to remain ignorant of it.

            In addition, I made known the laws of nature, and without basing my reasoning on any principle other than the infinite perfections of God, I tried to demonstrate all of these laws about which one could entertain any doubts, to show that they are such that, although God could have created several worlds, there would not be one where these failed to be observed. After that, I showed how the greatest part of material in chaos would have to, as a result of these laws, organize and arrange itself in a certain way which made it similar to our heavens, how, in so doing, some of its parts must have made up an earth and some parts planets and comets, and some other parts a sun and fixed stars.

            And at this point, dwelling on the subject of light, I explained at some length the nature of light which must be found in the sun and the stars, how from there it crossed in an instant the immense distances of heavenly space, and how it is reflected from the planets and comets towards the earth. To this I added several things concerning the material, the arrangement, the movements, and all the various qualities of our heavens and the stars. Consequently, I thought I had said enough about these matters to make known the fact that one observes nothing in these features of this world which must not, or at least could not, appear entirely similar to those of the world which I described.

            From there I went on to speak in particular about the earth, about how, although I had expressly assumed that God had placed no heaviness in the material of which it is composed, all its parts could not help tending to move precisely to its centre, how, having water and air on its surface, the arrangement of the heavens and the stars, and particularly of the moon, had to create on earth an ebb and flow similar in all its features to the ones we see in our oceans, and, beyond that, a certain flow in the water as well as in the air, from east to west, like the one we observe between the tropics, how the mountains, seas, fountains, and rivers can naturally form out of that, how earth's metals come into the mines, and how the plants on earth grow in the fields, and, in general, how all the things we call mixed or composite could be produced on earth.

            And, among other things, because there is nothing on earth which produces light except fire (other than the stars), I studied to understand clearly everything associated with the nature of fire, how it arises, how it is nourished, how sometimes it has heat without light and sometimes light without heat, how it can introduce various colours in different bodies, as well as various other qualities, how it melts some things and makes others harder, how it can consume almost everything or convert it into ash and smoke, and finally how, out of these cinders, simply by the violence of its actions, it makes glass. For this transformation of cinders into glass seemed to be as wonderful as anything else which happens in nature, and I took particular pleasure in describing it.

            However, I don't want to suggest from all these things that this world was created in the fashion which I was proposing. For it is much more probable that God made the world from the beginning just what it had to be. But it is certain, and this is an opinion commonly received among theologians, that the actions by which God now preserves the world are exactly the same as the method by which He created it, in such a way that even if He did not give it at the start any form other than a chaos, providing that He had first established the laws of nature and had given His assistance, so that it would act as it usually does, we can believe, without denying the miracle of creation, that because of these facts all purely material things would have been able, over time, to become the way we now observe them, and their nature is much easier to conceive when one sees them born gradually in this way than if one thinks of them only as made all at once.

            From the description of the inanimate bodies and of plants, I moved onto the bodies of animals and especially the body of man. But because I did not yet have sufficient knowledge to speak of that in the same way as of other things, that is to say, to speak of effects in terms of causes, by revealing the seeds and the methods by which nature had to produce them, I contented myself with assuming that God formed the human body completely like one of our own, both the external shape of its limbs and the arrangement of its inner organs, without making them of any material other than the one which I had described and without, at the start, placing in that body any reasonable soul or any other thing to serve the body as a vegetative or sensitive soul, except that He kindled in its heart one of those fires without light which I had already explained and which I conceived as in no way different in its nature from the fire which heats hay when it is closed up in a sack or which makes new wines bubble when they are allowed to ferment after crushing. For, by examining the functions which, as a result of this assumption, could be present in this body, I found precisely all those which could be in us without our thinking about them, and thus without any contribution from our soul, that is to say, the distinct part of the body whose nature is solely to think (as I have said above), the functions which we can say are all those in which the animals without reason are similar to us. But in doing this, I could not find any of those which, because they are dependent on thought, are the only ones which pertain to us, as men; whereas, I found all of them afterwards, once I assumed the God had created a reasonable soul and joined it to this body in the particular way which I described.

            But so that you can see how I dealt with this material, I want to put in here the explanation for the movement of the heart and the arteries, the first and the most universal thing which one observes in animals. From that one will easily assess what one should think of all the others. And so that people have less difficulty understanding what I am going to say, I would like those who are not versed in anatomy to take the trouble, before reading this, to have the heart of some large animal with lungs dissected in front of them. For it is in all respects quite similar to the heart in man. And I would like them to have demonstrated to them the two chambers or cavities which are in that heart.

            First, there is one chamber on its right side, to which two very large tubes are attached, that is, the vena cava, which is the principal receptacle of blood, as it were, the trunk of the tree of which all the other veins of the body are the branches, and the vena arteriosa*, which has, with that label, been poorly named, because it is, in fact, an artery, the one which, originating at the heart, divides up, after leaving the heart, into several branches, which go out to distribute themselves throughout the lungs. Then there is the chamber on the left side of the heart, to which, in the same way, two tubes are attached, which are as large or larger than the ones just mentioned: that is, the venous artery, which is also misnamed, because it is nothing but a vein which comes from the lungs, where it is divided into several branches interwoven with those from the arterial vein and with those associated with the tube called the windpipe, through which air enters for respiration; and the large artery which, leaving the heart, sends its branches throughout the body.

            I would also like someone to point out carefully to them the eleven small strips of skin which, just like small gates, open and close the four openings in these two chambers, that is, three at the entry of the vena cava, where they are so arranged that they cannot in any way prevent the blood contained in the vena cava from flowing into the right chamber of the heart and, at the same time, effectively prevent its ability to flow out; three gates at the entry of arterial vein, which, being arranged in precisely the opposite way, easily allow the blood in this chamber to move toward the lungs but do not allow the blood in the lungs to return to that chamber of the heart.

            Then, in the same way, there are two other strips of membrane at the opening to the venous artery which allow the blood from the lungs to flow towards the left chamber of the heart, but prevent its return, and there are three at the entry of the great artery which allow blood to leave the heart but prevent it from returning there. There is no need to seek for any reason for the number of these membranes, beyond the fact that since the venous artery is an oval, because of its location, it can be readily closed with two; whereas, since the others are round, they can be more easily closed with three.

            In addition, I would like people to notice that the large artery and the arterial vein have a composition much harder and firmer than the venous artery and the vena cava, that these last two get bigger before entering the heart and there make a structure similar to small sacks, called the auricles of the heart, which are composed of flesh like that of the heart, that there is always more heat in the heart than in any other place in the body; and finally that, if any drop of blood enters its cavities, this heat in the heart is capable of making this drop quickly swell and expand, just as all liquors generally do when one lets them fall drop by drop into some really hot container.

            After all that, I have no need to say anything to explain the movement of the heart, other than the following: when its cavities are not full of blood, then necessarily blood flows from the vena cava into the right chamber and from the venous artery into the left, because these two blood vessels are always full and their openings, which are oriented towards the heart, cannot then be blocked. But as soon as two drops of blood have entered the heart in this way, one in each chamber, these drops, which could only be of a considerable size because the openings through which they enter are very large and the vessels they come from are really full of blood, become thinner and expand, on account of the heat they encounter there, as a result of which they make the entire heart expand, and then they push against and close the five small gates which stand at the openings of the two vessels from which these drops of blood have come, thus preventing any more blood from moving down into the heart.

            And, continuing to become increasingly thinner, the drops of blood push against and open the six other small gates which stand at the opening of the two other vessels, through which they flow out, in this way causing all the branches of the arterial vein and great artery to expand, almost at the same instant as the heart, which immediately afterwards contracts, as do the arteries as well, because the blood which has entered them gets colder again, and their six small gates close once more. Then the five valves on the vena cava and the venous artery re-open, and allow passage of two more drops of blood, which, once more, make the heart and the arteries expand, just as in the preceding steps. And because the blood which enters the heart in this manner passes through these two small sacks called auricles, this motion causes the movement of the auricles to be the opposite of the heart's movement�they contract when the heart expands.

            As for the rest, so that those who do not understand the force of mathematical proofs and who are not accustomed to distinguishing true reasons from probable reasons do not venture to deny this matter without examining it, I wish to advise them that this movement which I have just explained is as necessarily a result of the mere arrangement of the organs which one can see in the heart with one's own eyes and of the heat which one can feel there with one's fingers and of the nature of blood which one can recognize from experience, as the movement of a clock is necessarily a result of the force, the placement, and the shape of its counter-weights and wheels.

            But if someone asks how the blood in the veins does not exhaust itself as it flows continually into the heart in this way and how the arteries are not overfilled because all the blood which passes through the heart goes into them, there's no need for me to say anything in reply other than what has already been written by an English doctor, to whom we must give the honour of having broken the ice in this area and of being the first to teach that there are several small passages at the extremities of the arteries through which the blood which they receive from the heart enters into the small branches of the veins, from where it proceeds to move once again towards the heart, so that its passage is nothing other than a constant circulation.*

            This point is really well demonstrated by the common experience of surgeons who, having bound up an arm moderately tightly above a place where they have opened a vein, cause the blood to flow out more abundantly than if they had not tied the arm. And the opposite happens if they place the binding below the cut, between the hand and the opening, or if they make the binding above the opening very tight.

            For it is clear that the binding, when moderately tight, can only prevent the blood which is already in the arm from returning towards the heart by the veins, but in doing that the binding does not stop the blood from continuing to flow to the place from the arteries, because the arteries are situated below the veins and because the skin of the arteries, being harder, is less easy to press down. Thus, the blood which comes from the heart tends to move with more force through the arteries towards the hand than it does in returning from the hand towards the heart through the veins. And because this blood leaves the arm by the opening in one of the veins, it must necessarily be the case that there are some passages below this binding, that is to say, towards the extremities of the arm, through which it can come there from the arteries.

            Harvey also demonstrates really well what he says about the flow of blood through certain small membranes which are so arranged in various places along the veins that they do not allow blood to move in the veins from the middle of the body towards the extremities, but only to return from the extremities towards the heart. Moreover, he demonstrates this by an experiment which shows that all the blood which is in the body can leave it in a very little time by a single artery, if it is cut, even more so if it has been tightly bound really close to the heart and cut between the heart and the binding, so that one simply could not imagine any explanation other than that the blood flowing out is coming from the heart.

            But there are several other things which attest that the true cause of this movement of blood is as I have described it. For, firstly, the difference which one notices between the blood which comes from the veins and the blood which flows out of the arteries could come about only if the blood is rarefied and, as it were, distilled in passing through the heart. It is more subtle, more lively, and warmer immediately after leaving the heart, that is to say, in the arteries, than it is shortly before entering the heart, that is to say, when it is in the veins. And if one pays attention, one will find that this difference is only readily apparent close to the heart and not so evident in places which are more distant from it.

            Then, the hardness of the skins making up the arterial vein and the large artery shows sufficiently well that the blood beats against them with greater force than it does against the skin of the veins. And why would the left chamber of the heart and the great artery be more ample and larger than the right chamber and the arterial vein, if it were not for the fact that the blood of the venous artery, which has only been in the lungs since passing through the heart, is more subtle and more strongly and more easily rarefied than the blood which comes immediately from the vena cava?

            And what could doctors diagnose by testing the pulse, if they did not know, in keeping with the fact that blood changes its nature, that it can be rarefied by the heat of the heart more or less strongly and more or less quickly than before? And if one examines how this heat is transferred to the other limbs, is it not necessary to admit that it is by means of the blood, which, passing through the heart, is re-heated and from there spreads throughout the body? That's the reason why, if one takes blood from some part of the body, in that very process one takes the heat, and even if the heart were as hot as a burning fire, it would not be sufficient to re-heat the feet and the hands as much as it does, if it did not continually send new blood there.

            From this we also understand that the true purpose of respiration is to bring sufficient fresh air into the lungs to ensure that the blood which comes from the right chamber of the heart, where it has been rarefied and, as it were, changed into vapour, thickens and changes back again into blood, before falling back into the left chamber, without which it would not be fit to serve as nourishment for the fire there. What confirms this is that we observe that the animals which have no lungs also have only one cavity in the heart and that children, who cannot use their lungs while they are closed up in their mother's womb, have an opening through which blood flows from the vena cava into the left cavity of their hearts and a passage by which the blood comes from the arterial vein into the large artery without passing through the lungs.

            Next, how would digestion take place in the stomach, if the heart did not send heat there through the arteries and with that some of the more easily flowing parts of the blood which help to dissolve the food we have sent there? And the action which converts the juice of this food into blood�surely that is easy to understand, if one considers that it is distilled, as it passes and re-passes through the heart, perhaps more than one or two hundred times each day?

            What else do we need to explain nutrition and the production of the various humours in the body, other than to say that the force with which the blood, as it gets rarefied, passes from the heart towards the extremities of the arteries, brings it about that some portions of it stop among those parts of the limbs where they are, and there take the place of some other parts which the blood pushes away, and that, depending on the situation or the shape or the smallness of the pores which these parts of blood encounter, some of them go off to certain places rather than to others, in the same way that anyone can see with various screens, which, being pierced in different ways, serve to separate various grains from one another.

            Finally, what is most remarkable in all this is the generation of animal spirits which resemble a very slight wind or rather a very pure and lively flame which, by climbing continually in great quantities from the heart into the brain, goes from there through the nerves into the muscles and gives movement to all the limbs, without it being necessary to imagine any other cause which has the effect of making the most agitated and most penetrating parts of blood, those most appropriate for making up these animal spirits, move towards the brain rather than elsewhere, other than that the arteries which carry these parts of the blood are those which come from the heart toward the brain by the most direct route and that, following the laws of mechanics, which are the same as nature's laws, when several things collectively tend to move towards the same place where there is insufficient room for all of them, as the parts of blood which leave the left cavity of the heart tend towards the brain, the most feeble and less agitated parts must be turned away from the brain by the strongest parts. In this way, only the latter parts reach the brain.

            I explained in particular detail all these things in the treatise which I had planned to publish previously. And then I demonstrated what the nerves and muscles in the human body were made of, so that the animal spirits, once inside the nerves, would have the power to move its limbs, as one sees that heads, for a little while after being cut off, continue to move and bite the earth, in spite of the fact that they are no longer animated. I also showed what changes must take places in the brain to cause the waking state, sleep, and dreams, how light, sounds, smells, tastes, heat, and all the other qualities of external objects could imprint various ideas on the brain through the mediation of the senses, just as hunger, thirst, and the other inner passions can also send their ideas to the brain; which of them must be taken there for common sense and where these ideas are taken in, for memory which preserves them, and for fantasy which can change them in various ways and compose new ones, and, in the same way, distribute animal spirits to the muscles and make the limbs of the body move in all the different ways�in relation to the objects which present themselves to the senses and in relation to the interior physical passions�our bodies can move themselves without being led by the will.

            None of this will seem strange to those who know how many varieties of automata, or moving machines, human industry can make, by using only very few pieces in comparison with the huge number of bones, muscles, nerves, arteries, veins, and all the other parts in the body of each animal. They will look on this body as a machine, which, having been made by the hand of God, is incomparably better ordered and more inherently admirable in its movements than any of those which human beings could have invented.

            And here, in particular, I stopped to reveal that if there were machines which had the organs and the external shape of a monkey or of some other animal without reason, we would have no way of recognizing that they were not exactly the same nature as the animals; whereas, if there was a machine shaped like our bodies which imitated our actions as much as is morally possible, we would always have two very certain ways of recognizing that they were not, for all their resemblance, true human beings.

            The first of these is that they would never be able to use words or other signs to make words as we do to declare our thoughts to others.  For one can easily imagine a machine made in such a way that it expresses words, even that it expresses some words relevant to some physical actions which bring about some change in its organs (for example, if one touches it in some spot, the machine asks what it is that one wants to say to it; if in another spot, it cries that one has hurt it, and things like that), but one cannot imagine a machine that arranges words in various ways to reply to the sense of everything said in its presence, as the most stupid human beings are capable of doing.

            The second test is that, although these machines might do several things as well or perhaps better than we do, they are inevitably lacking in some other, through which we discover that they act, not by knowledge, but only by the arrangement of their organs. For, whereas reason is a universal instrument which can serve in all sorts of encounters, these organs need some particular arrangement for each particular action. As a result of that, it is morally impossible that there is in a machine's organs sufficient variety to act in all the events of our lives in the same way that our reason empowers us to act.

            Now, by these two same means, one can also recognize the difference between human beings and animals. For it is really remarkable that there are no men so dull and stupid, including even idiots, who are not capable of putting together different words and of creating out of them a conversation through which they make their thoughts known; by contrast, there is no other animal, no matter how perfect and how successful it might be, which can do anything like that. And this inability does not come about from a lack of organs For we see that magpies and parrots can emit words, as we can, but nonetheless cannot talk like us, that is to say, giving evidence that they are thinking about what they are uttering; whereas, men who are born deaf and dumb are deprived of organs which other people use to speak�just as much as or more than the animals�but they have a habit of inventing on their own some signs by which they can make themselves understood to those who, being usually with them, have the spare time to learn their language.

            And this point attests not merely to the fact that animals have less reason than men, but also to the fact that they have none at all. For we see that it takes very little for someone to learn how to speak, and since we observe inequality among the animals of the same species just as much as among human beings, and see that some are easier to train than others, it would be incredible that a monkey or a parrot which is the most perfect of his species was not equivalent in speaking to the most stupid child or at least a child with a troubled brain, unless their soul had a nature totally different from our own. And one should not confuse words with natural movements which attest to the passions and can be imitated by machines as well as by animals, nor should one think, like some ancients, that animals talk, although we do not understand their language. For if that were true, because they have several organs related to our own, they could just as easily make themselves understood to us as to the animals like them.

            Another truly remarkable thing is that, although there are several animals which display more industry in some of their actions than we do, we nonetheless see that they do not display that at all in many other actions. Thus, the fact that they do better than we do does not prove that they have a mind, for, if that were the case, they would have more of it than any of us and would do better in all other things; it rather shows that they have no reason at all, and that it's nature which has activated them according to the arrangement of their organs�just as one sees that a clock, which is composed only of wheels and springs, can keep track of the hours and measure time more accurately than we can, for all our care.

            After that, I described the reasonable soul and revealed that it cannot be inferred in any way from the power of matter, like the other things I have spoken about, but that it must be expressly created, and I described how it is not sufficient that it is lodged in the human body like a pilot in his ship, perhaps simply to move its limbs, but that it is necessary that the soul is joined and united more closely with the body, so that it has, in addition, feelings and appetites similar to ours and thus makes up a true human being.

            As for the rest, here I went on at some length on the subject of the soul, because it is among the most important. For, apart from the error of those who deny God, which I believe I have adequately refuted above, there is nothing which distances feeble minds from the right road of virtue more readily than to imagine that the soul of animals is the same nature as our own and that thus we have nothing either to fear or to hope for after this life, any more than flies and ants do; whereas, once one knows how different they are, one understands much better the reasons which prove that the nature of our souls is totally independent of the body, and thus it is not at all subject to dying along with the body. Then, to the extent that one cannot see other causes which destroy the soul, one is naturally led to judge that the soul is immortal.

 

Part Six

            It is now three years since I reached the end of the treatise which contains all these things and since I started to revise it in order to put it into the hands of a printer. Then I learned that people to whom I defer and whose authority over my actions could hardly be less than my own reason over my thoughts expressed disapproval of an opinion about physics published a little earlier by someone else*. I don't wish to say that I subscribed to that opinion, but, although I had observed nothing before their censure which I could imagine prejudicial to religion or the state, and thus nothing which would have prevented me from writing if reason persuaded me, after that I was nevertheless afraid that there might be something among my opinions where I had gone astray, notwithstanding the great care I always took not to accept new ideas into my beliefs for which I did not have very certain proofs and not to write anything which would work to anyone's disadvantage. This was sufficient to oblige me to alter my resolution to publish my opinions. For although the reasons I had adopted earlier had been very strong, my inclination, which has always led me to hate the profession of producing books, made me immediately find enough other reasons to excuse myself in this matter. And, given the nature of these reasons, on one side or the other, I'm quite interested, not only in stating them here, but also in the possibility that the public may learn something about them.

            I have never made a great deal of the things which come from my own mind, so while I gathered no other fruits from the method I was using, other than that I satisfied myself concerning some difficulties in the speculative sciences or else that I tried to regulate my morals by reasons which my method taught me, I did not think myself obliged to write anything. For where morals are concerned, every person is so full of his own good sense that it would be possible to find as many reformers as heads, if it was permitted to people (other than those God has established as sovereigns over his people or those to whom he has given sufficient grace and zeal to be prophets) to try changing anything in our morality. Although my speculations pleased me a great deal, I thought that other people had their own speculations which pleased them perhaps even more.

            But immediately after I had acquired some general notions concerning physics and, by starting to test them on various particular difficulties, had noticed just where they could lead and how much they differed from principles which people have used up to the present time, I thought that I could not keep them hidden without sinning greatly against the law which obliges us to promote as much as we can the general good of all men. For my notions had made me see that it is possible to reach understandings which are extremely useful for life, and that instead of the speculative philosophy which is taught in the schools, we can find a practical philosophy by which, through understanding the force and actions of fire, air, stars, heavens, and all the other bodies which surround us as distinctly as we understand the various crafts of our artisans, we could use them in the same way for all applications for which they are appropriate and thus make ourselves, as it were, the masters and possessors of nature.

            But it was not only my desire for the invention of an infinite number of devices which might enable us to enjoy without effort the fruits of the earth and all the commodities found in it, but mainly also my desire for the preservation of our health, which is, without doubt, the principal benefit and the foundation of all the others in this life. For even the mind depends so much on the temperament and the condition of the organs of the body that, if it is possible to find some means to make human beings generally wiser and more skilful than they have been up to this point, I believe we must seek that in medicine.  It is true that the medicine now practiced contains few things which are remarkably useful. But without having any design to denigrate it, I am confident that there is no one, not even those who make a living from medicine, who would not claim that everything we know in medicine is almost nothing in comparison to what remains to be known about it and that we could liberate ourselves from an infinity of illnesses, both of the body and the mind, and also perhaps even of the infirmities of ageing, if we had sufficient knowledge of their causes and of all the remedies which nature has provided for us.

            Now, intending to spend all my life in research into such a necessary science and having encountered a road which seemed to me such that one should infallibly find this science, unless one was prevented either by the brevity of one's life or by the lack of experiments, I judged that there was no better remedy against these two obstacles than to communicate faithfully and completely to the public the little I had found and to invite good minds to try to move on further, by contributing, each according to his own inclination and power, to the experiments which need to be conducted and by communicating to the public everything they learn, so that the most recent people begin where the previous ones have finished. If we thus joined the lives and labours of many people, collectively we might go much further than each particular person could.

         Besides, I notice that, where experiments are concerned, they are increasingly necessary as one's knowledge advances, for at the beginning it is better to conduct only those which present themselves to our sense and which we cannot ignore, provided that we engage in a little reflection, than to seek out more rare and original experiments, because these rarer ones are misleading, when we do not yet know the causes of the more common phenomena, and the circumstances on which they depend are almost always so particular and so precise, that it is very difficult to observe them.

            In this work I kept to the following order: first, I tried to find the general principles or the first causes of everything which exists or could exist in the world, without taking into my account of this effect anything other than the fact that God alone created it, not deducing anything additional, other than certain grains of truth which are naturally in our souls. After that, I examined what were the first and most common effects we could deduce from these causes. By doing that, it seems to me, I found the heavens, the stars, and earth, and even on the earth water, air, fire, minerals, and some other things, the sort which are the most common of all and the simplest, and thus the easiest to know.

            Then, when I wanted to move down to more particular matters, so many varied ones presented themselves to me that I did not think it would be possible for the human mind to distinguish the forms or species of bodies on the earth from an infinity of others which could exist there if the will of God had put them there and, thus, that one could not adapt them to our use, unless one proceeded to the causes through the effects and that one made use of several particular experiments.

            After that, I turned my mind onto all the objects which had ever presented themselves to my senses. I venture to say that I didn't notice in them anything which I could not explain easily enough by the principles which I had found. But I must also confess that the power of nature is so ample and vast and that its principles are so simple and so general that I observed hardly any particular effect which I did not immediately understand as being capable of being deduced in several different ways, so that my greatest difficulty is usually to find on which of these ways the effect depends. And to resolve this matter, I did not know any other expedient than, once again, to look for some experiments which would be such that their outcomes would not be the same if one of these ways had to explain it rather than some other way.

            As for the rest, I am now at a point where I perceive well enough, it seems to me, the method one has to use to make most of those experiments which can serve for this purpose. But I also see that they are of such a kind and that there are so many of them that neither my hands nor my income, even if I had a thousand times more of both than I do, could suffice for all of them, so that my progress in understanding nature will be proportional to the means I have for conducting more or fewer experiments. This was what I promised myself I would make known in the treatise which I wrote, as well as showing in it the practical value which the public could gain from these experiments so clearly that I would oblige all those who wished to promote the general well being of man, that is to say, all those who are truly virtuous and who are not false (by pretending to virtue or merely virtuous by public opinion), to communicate to me all the experiments which they have already made, as well as to help me in researching those which remain to be done.

            But since that time I had other reasons which made me change my mind and think that I really must continue to write down all matters which I judged to have some importance, to the extent that I discovered truth in them, and to bring to my writing the same care that I would if I wanted it published, so that I would have more time to examine such things well, since there is no doubt one always looks more closely at what one thinks many people must see than at what one does only for oneself, and often matters which seemed to me true when I began to think of them appeared false when I wished to put them on paper. By writing things down, I would not lose any opportunity to benefit the public, if I could, and, if my writings are worth anything, those who have them after my death could use them wherever they were most relevant. But I thought I must not, on any account, agree that they be published during my life, so as to prevent the hostility and controversies which they could perhaps arouse and the sort of reputation which I could acquire from causing me to waste time which I planned to use to instruct myself.

            For although it is true that each man is obliged to provide as much as is in him for the good of others and that there is no value whatsoever in anything which has no benefit for anyone, nevertheless it is also true that we should care about things more distant than the present and that it is good to forget about things which might bring some benefit to those now living when one's intention is to create other things which will bring more benefits to our descendants. In fact, I really wanted people to understand that the little I had learned up to this point was almost nothing in comparison with what I was ignorant of and what I did not despair of being able to learn. For it is almost the same with those who discover truth little by little in the sciences as it is with those who, once they start to become rich, have less trouble in making large acquisitions than they did previously, when they were poorer, in making much smaller ones. Or, again, one can compare them to leaders of armies whose forces usually grow in proportion to their victories and who, in order to capture towns and provinces, need more leadership to maintain their forces after the loss of a battle than they do after winning one. For it is truly a matter of giving battle when one tries to overcome all the difficulties and mistakes which prevent us from reaching an understanding of the truth. And it is a battle loss when one accepts some false opinion concerning any matter at all general and important. Afterwards one requires a great deal more skill to put oneself in the same condition one was in previously than one does to make great progress when one already has confirmed principles.

            In my case, if I have previously found some truths in the sciences (and I hope that the matters contained in this volume will make people conclude that I have found some), I can say that those are only the consequences of and dependent upon five or six major difficulties which I overcame and that I count these as battles in which victory was on my side. Still, I am not afraid to state that I only need to win two or three others like those in order to reach the final goal of my project and that I am not so advanced in years. Thus, given the ordinary course of nature, I still have enough leisure to bring my project to its conclusion. But I think that I am all the more obliged to manage the time remaining to me, now that I have more hope of being able to use it well, and I would, no doubt, have many chances to lose that time, if I published the foundations of my physics. For although these foundations are almost all so evident that one need only hear them to believe them and there are none of them which, in my view, I cannot prove, nevertheless, because it is impossible that they will agree with all the various opinions of other men, I anticipate being often distracted by the hostility they will give rise to.

            One could say that this opposition would be useful, to the extent it makes me understand my mistakes, and that, if I have anything good, others will by this means have a more complete understanding. Since several people can see more than one man by himself, if people begin from now on making use of my principles, they will also help me with their inventions. But even though I recognize that I am very subject to error and that I almost never have faith in the first thoughts which come to me, nevertheless the experience which I have of objections which people could make about me prevents me from hoping for any benefit from such objections. For I have already undergone the criticism of many of those whom I held as friends and of some others who I thought considered me indifferently and even of some in whom I knew malignity and envy would try hard enough to uncover what affection concealed from my friends. But it rarely happened that someone made an objection which I had not totally anticipated, unless it was really distant from my subject, so that I have almost never met any censor of my opinions who did not appear to me to be less rigorous or less fair than myself.   Moreover, I have never observed that anyone has discovered any truth of which people were ignorant before by means of the disputes practised in the schools. For when each person tries to emerge victorious, people strive much harder to establish probability than to weigh the reasons on one side or the other, and those who have been good pleaders for a long time are not, on that account, better judges afterwards.

            As for the practical use which other people derive from the communication of my thoughts, it could not be all that great, since I have not taken them so far that there is no need to add a great deal of things before they can be practically applied. And I think I can say without vanity that if there is anyone who can do that, the person should be me rather than someone else, not because several minds incomparably better than mine could not be found in this world, but because one cannot conceive of something so well and make it one's own when one learns it from someone else as when one comes up with it oneself. What's really true about this material is that, although I have often explained some of my opinions to people with very good minds, who, while I was talking to them, seemed to understand my opinions very clearly, nonetheless, when they have repeated them, I have noticed that almost always they have changed them in such a way that I would no longer admit them as mine.

               Incidentally, I am more than happy to take this opportunity to beg our descendants never to believe anything that people will tell them comes from me, when I never divulged them myself, and I am not astonished at the extravagant things which people attribute to those ancient philosophers whose writing we do not possess. I don't judge that their thoughts were really irrational on that account, seeing that they were the best minds of their times, but assume that their thoughts have been misrepresented to us. For we see also that it almost never happens that any of their disciples surpasses them, and I'm confident that the most passionate of those people who follow Aristotle nowadays would consider themselves fortunate if they could have as much knowledge of nature as he had, even on condition that they would never know any more. They are like ivy which tends not to climb higher than the trees which support it and which often even comes down again when it has reached the tree tops. For it seems to me that those people also come back down, that is, make themselves in some fashion less knowledgeable than if they were to abandon their studying, when, not content with knowing everything intelligibly explained by their author, they wish to find, beyond that, the solution to several difficulties about which he has said nothing and has perhaps never even thought.

               However, their way of practising philosophy is extremely comfortable for those who have nothing but really mediocre minds, for the obscurity of the distinctions and the principles they use enables them to speak of everything as boldly as they know how and to hold to everything that they state against the most subtle and skilful minds, without their having the means to convince anyone. In this it strikes me they are similar to a blind man who, in order to fight on equal terms against someone who can see, makes him come into the bottom of some really obscure cave. And I can state that such people have an interest in my abstaining from publishing the principles of philosophy I used, because, given that they are very simple and very evident, if I published them, I would be doing roughly the equivalent of opening some windows and bringing the light of day into this cave where they have gone down to fight each other.

            But even the best minds have no occasion to want to know these principles. For if they want to know how to speak about everything and to acquire the reputation of being scholarly, they will get there more easily in contenting themselves with probability which can be found in all sorts of matters without great trouble, rather than by seeking out the truth, which is not discovered except little by little in some matters and which, when it is a question of speaking of other matters, requires us to confess frankly that we are ignorant of them. If they would rather have the undoubtedly preferable condition of knowing a few truths over the vanity of appearing to be ignorant about nothing, and if they wish to follow a plan similar to my own, for that they do not need me to say anything more than I have already said in this discourse. For if they are capable of moving on further than I have done, they will also, with all the more reason, find for themselves everything I think I have found.

            Since I have never looked at anything except in an orderly way, it is certain that what remains for me to discover is inherently more difficult and more hidden than what I have been able to find, and they would have much less pleasure in learning that from me than from themselves. Beyond that, the habit they will acquire by searching first for easy things and then moving on gradually by degrees to other more difficult things will serve them better than all my instructions will be able to.

            As for me, I am convinced that if I had been taught from my youth all the truths which I have found since my demonstrations and if I had had no trouble in learning them, I would perhaps have never known any others. At the very least I would never have acquired the habit and the skill which I think I have in finding new truths to the extent that I apply myself in looking for them. In a word, if there is in the world some work which cannot be properly completed by anyone other than the same person who started it, it�s the work I do.

            It's true that so far the experiments which can help in that work are concerned, one man by himself is not sufficient to undertake them all. But he cannot put to practical use hands other than his own, except those of craftsmen or such people as he can pay, who with the hope of profit, which is a very effective means, will carry out everything exactly as he instructs them. As for volunteers who from curiosity or a desire to learn perhaps offer to help him, apart from the fact that ordinarily they promise more than they deliver and that they come up with nothing but fine propositions, none of which ever succeeds, they inevitably want to paid with the explanation of some difficulties or at least with compliments and useless discussions which would cost him more time than he could afford.

            As for the experiments which other people have carried out, even though they should be willing enough to tell him about them, those who call such experiments secrets will never do that. Such experiments for the most part contain so many superfluous circumstances or ingredients that it would be very difficult for him to decipher the truth of them. Beyond that, he would find almost all of them badly explained or even false, because those who have carried them out have forced themselves to make the experiment apparently conform to their principles, so that if there were some experiments he could use, once again it would not be worth the time he would have to take up to pick them out.

            In the same way, if there were in the world someone in whom people had great confidence that he was capable of finding the greatest things and the most useful for the public as possible, and if for this reason other men tried hard to help him in every way to carry out his project with success, I don't see that they could do anything for him other than to furnish the costs of the experiments he needed to carry out, and, as to the rest, they could prevent his leisure from being taken away by anyone's importunity. But beyond the fact that I do not presume so much of myself as to wish to promise anything extraordinary and that I do not indulge in thoughts so vain as to imagine to myself that the pubic ought to show a great deal of interest in my plans, I do not have a soul so base that I would be willing to accept from anyone a favour which people might think I did not deserve.

            All these considerations combined were the reason, three years ago, that I did not wish to publish the treatise which I had in my hands.  I even made a resolution that during my life I would not make public any other treatise which was so general and from which one could learn the foundations of my physics. But, once again, there have been two other reasons since then which have obliged me to set down here some particular essays and to give the public some account of my actions and my plans.

            The first is that if I failed to do this, several people who knew of the intention I had previously of publishing some of my writing could imagine that the reasons why I held back from doing so were more disadvantageous to me than they were. For, although I do not like glory excessively, or, if I dare say it, although I dislike it to the extent that I see it as contrary to peace and quiet, which I value above everything, nonetheless I have also never tried to hide my actions as if they were crimes, nor have I taken many precautions to remain unknown, as much because I would have thought myself wrong if I did so, as because that would have given me a sort of unease which would, once again, have been contrary to the perfect peace of mind which I am looking for.  Also, being always indifferently poised between care to get known or not to get known, since I could not prevent myself from acquiring some kind of reputation, I thought that I ought to do my best at least to avoid having a bad one.

            The other reason which obliged me to write this is that I realized more and more every day how the plan I had to teach myself was suffering a delay, because of an infinite number of experiments I needed and because it is impossible that I carry them out without the help of others. Although I do not flatter myself so much as to hope that the public pays great attention to my interests, nonetheless by the same token I do not want to let myself down so much so that I give an excuse for those who will come after me to reproach me some day by saying that I could have done many things much better than I did, if I had not so neglected making them understand the ways in which they could contribute to my project.

            And I thought that it would be easy for me to chose some matters which, without being subject to a great deal of controversy and without requiring me to state more of my principles than I wanted to, would permit me to reveal with sufficient clarity what I could or could not do in the sciences. In these matters I cannot say if I have been successful, and I have no desire to ward off anyone's criticism, as I talk in person about my own writings. But I will be very pleased if people examine them. In order for people to have more chances to do this, I request that all those who have some objections take the trouble to send them to my publisher. If he tells me about them, I will try to attach my response to their objection and publish them at the same time. In this way, the readers, seeing the objections and my replies together, will judge the truth all the more easily. For I promise never to make long replies but only to confess my errors very candidly, if I recognize them, or else, if I cannot see them, to state simply what I believe is required for the defence of what I have written, without adding there an explanation of any new material, so that I don't get endlessly involved with one matter after another.

            If some of those things which I have talked about at the beginning of the Dioptrics and Meteors are shocking at first, because I call them suppositions and I do not seem to have any desire to prove them, I urge people to have the patience to read the whole text with attention, and I hope that they will be satisfied. For it seems to me that the reasons follow in sequence in such a way that the last ones are established by the first ones, which are their causes, and the first ones are reciprocally established by the last ones which are their effects. And people should not imagine that, in doing this, I am committing the error which logicians call arguing in a circle. For since experimentation makes most of these effects very certain, the causes which I have deduced do not serve so much to prove these effects as to explain them, so the case is precisely reversed: it is the causes which are proved by the effects.

            And I used the name suppositions for these causes so that people might know what I think I can deduce from them about these first truths which I have explained above. But I expressly wanted to avoid doing that, in order to prevent certain minds who imagine that they understand in a single day everything that another man has thought out in twenty years, as soon as he has said only two or three words about these matters to them, and who are all the more subject to error and less capable of truth, the more penetrating and bright they are, from taking the opportunity to construct some extravagant philosophy on what they believe are my principles, and in order to prevent people from attributing the fault for that to me.

            As for the opinions which are entirely mine, I do not seek to excuse them as new. To the extent that people think carefully about the reasons for them, I am confident that they will find my opinions so simple and so consistent with common sense that they will seem less extraordinary and less strange than some others which people might have on the same subjects. And, in addition, I do not boast that I am the first inventor of any of them, although I have never accepted them merely because they were said by others or because they have not been said by others, but simply because reason persuaded me to accept them.

            If craftsmen cannot immediately carry out the inventions explained in the Dioptrics, I don't think that people can, for that reason, say that the text is a poor one. For to the extent that dexterity and skill are required to make and to adjust the machines which I have described, without missing the slightest detail, I would be no less amazed if they were successful on the first attempt than if someone could learn in a single day to play the lute extremely well, simply because someone had given him a good musical score.

            If I write in French, the language of my country, rather than in Latin, the language of my teachers, the reason is that I hope those who use only their natural reason, pure and simple, will judge my opinions better that those who believe nothing but ancient books. And as for those who combine good sense with study, who are the only ones I hope to have as my judges, I am confident that they will not be so partial to Latin that they will refuse to listen to my reasons because I explain them in the common language.

            As for the rest, I do not wish to talk here in particular detail about the future progress which I hope to make in the sciences, nor to commit myself to promising the public what I am not confident of achieving. But I will only say that I have resolved not to use the time remaining to me for anything other than trying to acquire some knowledge of nature of such a kind that people can derive from it rules for medicine more reliable that those which they have at present, that my inclination keeps me so far away from all kinds of other projects, mainly those which can be practically useful to some people only by harming others, and that if some circumstance forced me to use my time in this way, I don't think I would be capable of succeeding.

            In these matters I am making a declaration here which I well understand cannot make me important in the world, but also I have no desire to be important. I will always hold myself more obliged to those by whose favour I enjoy my leisure unencumbered than to those who might offer me the most prestigious positions on earth.

First Meditation:
On what can be called into doubt
Some years ago I was struck by how many false things I
had believed, and by how doubtful was the structure of
beliefs that I had based on them. I realized that if I wanted
to establish anything in the sciences that was stable and
likely to last, I needed—just once in my life—to demolish
everything completely and start again from the foundations.
It looked like an enormous task, and I decided to wait until
I was old enough to be sure that there was nothing to be
gained from putting it off any longer. I have now delayed
it for so long that I have no excuse for going on planning
to do it rather than getting to work. So today I have set all
my worries aside and arranged for myself a clear stretch of
free time. I am here quite alone, and at last I will devote
myself, sincerely and without holding back, to demolishing
my opinions.
I can do this without showing that all my beliefs are false,
which is probably more than I could ever manage. My reason
tells me that as well as withholding assent from propositions
that are obviously •false, I should also withhold it from ones
that are •not completely certain and indubitable. So all I
need, for the purpose of rejecting all my opinions, is to find
in each of them at least some reason for doubt. I can do
this without going through them one by one, which would
take forever: once the foundations of a building have been
undermined, the rest collapses of its own accord; so I will
go straight for the basic principles on which all my former
beliefs rested.
Whatever I have accepted until now as most true has
come to me through my senses. But occasionally I have
found that they have deceived me, and it is unwise to trust
completely those who have deceived us even once.
[The next paragraph presents a series of considerations back and
forth. It is set out here as a discussion between two people, but that isn’t
how Descartes presented it.]
Hopeful: Yet although the senses sometimes deceive us
about objects that are very small or distant, that doesn’t
apply to my belief that I am here, sitting by the fire, wearing
a winter dressing-gown, holding this piece of paper in my
hands, and so on. It seems to be quite impossible to doubt
beliefs like these, which come from the senses. Another
example: how can I doubt that these hands or this whole
body are mine? To doubt such things I would have to liken
myself to brain-damaged madmen who are convinced they
are kings when really they are paupers, or say they are
dressed in purple when they are naked, or that they are
pumpkins, or made of glass. Such people are insane, and I
would be thought equally mad if I modelled myself on them.
Doubtful (sarcastically): What a brilliant piece of reasoning! As if I were not a man who sleeps at night and often has
all the same experiences while asleep as madmen do when
awake—indeed sometimes even more improbable ones. Often
in my dreams I am convinced of just such familiar events—
that I am sitting by the fire in my dressing-gown—when in
fact I am lying undressed in bed!
Hopeful: Yet right now my eyes are certainly wide open
when I look at this piece of paper; I shake my head and it
isn’t asleep; when I rub one hand against the other, I do it
deliberately and know what I am doing. This wouldn’t all
happen with such clarity to someone asleep.
1
Meditations René Descartes First Meditation
Doubtful: Indeed! As if I didn’t remember other occasions
when I have been tricked by exactly similar thoughts while
asleep! As I think about this more carefully, I realize that
there is never any reliable way of distinguishing being awake
from being asleep. This discovery makes me feel dizzy, [joke:]
which itself reinforces the notion that I may be asleep!
Suppose then that I am dreaming—it isn’t true that I,
with my eyes open, am moving my head and stretching out
my hands. Suppose, indeed that I don’t even have hands or
any body at all. Still, it has to be admitted that the visions
that come in sleep are like paintings: they must have been
made as copies of real things; so at least these general kinds
of things— eyes, head, hands and the body as a whole—must
be real and not imaginary. For even when painters try to
depict sirens and satyrs with the most extraordinary bodies,
they simply jumble up the limbs of different kinds of real
animals, rather than inventing natures that are entirely
new. If they do succeed in thinking up something completely
fictitious and unreal—not remotely like anything ever seen
before—at least the colours used in the picture must be real.
Similarly, although these general kinds of things— eyes,
head, hands and so on—could be imaginary, there is no
denying that certain even simpler and more universal kinds
of things are real. These are the elements out of which we
make all our mental images of things—the true and also the
false ones.
These simpler and more universal kinds include body,
and extension; the shape of extended things; their quantity,
size and number; the places things can be in, the time
through which they can last, and so on.
So it seems reasonable to conclude that physics, astronomy, medicine, and all other sciences dealing with things
that have complex structures are doubtful; while arithmetic,
geometry and other studies of the simplest and most general
things—whether they really exist in nature or not—contain
something certain and indubitable. For whether I am awake
or asleep, two plus three makes five, and a square has only
four sides. It seems impossible to suspect that such obvious
truths might be false.
However, I have for many years been sure that there is
an all-powerful God who made me to be the sort of creature
that I am. How do I know that he hasn’t brought it about
that there is no earth, no sky, nothing that takes up space,
no shape, no size, no place, while making sure that all these
things appear to me to exist? Anyway, I sometimes think
that others go wrong even when they think they have the
most perfect knowledge; so how do I know that I myself don’t
go wrong every time I add two and three or count the sides
of a square? Well, ·you might say·, God would not let me
be deceived like that, because he is said to be supremely
good. But, ·I reply·, if God’s goodness would stop him from
letting me be deceived •all the time, you would expect it to
stop him from allowing me to be deceived even •occasionally;
yet clearly I sometimes am deceived.
Some people would deny the existence of such a powerful
God rather than believe that everything else is uncertain.
Let us grant them—for purposes of argument—that there
is no God, and theology is fiction. On their view, then, I
am a product of fate or chance or a long chain of causes
and effects. But the less powerful they make my original
cause, the more likely it is that I am so imperfect as to be
deceived all the time—because deception and error seem to
be imperfections. Having no answer to these arguments, I
am driven back to the position that doubts can properly be
raised about any of my former beliefs. I don’t reach this
conclusion in a flippant or casual manner, but on the basis
of powerful and well thought-out reasons. So in future, if I
want to discover any certainty, I must withhold my assent
2
Meditations René Descartes Second Meditation
from these former beliefs just as carefully as I withhold it
from obvious falsehoods.
It isn’t enough merely to have noticed this, though; I must
make an effort to remember it. My old familiar opinions
keep coming back, and against my will they capture my
belief. It is as though they had a right to a place in my
belief-system as a result of long occupation and the law of
custom. These habitual opinions of mine are indeed highly
probable; although they are in a sense doubtful, as I have
shown, it is more reasonable to believe than to deny them.
But if I go on viewing them in that light I shall never get out
of the habit of confidently assenting to them. To conquer
that habit, therefore, I had better switch right around and
pretend (for a while) that these former opinions of mine are
utterly false and imaginary. I shall do this until I have
something to counter-balance the weight of old opinion,
and the distorting influence of habit no longer prevents me
from judging correctly. However far I go in my distrustful
attitude, no actual harm will come of it, because my project
won’t affect how I •act, but only how I •go about acquiring
knowledge.
So I shall suppose that some malicious, powerful, cunning demon has done all he can to deceive me—rather than
this being done by God, who is supremely good and the
source of truth. I shall think that the sky, the air, the
earth, colours, shapes, sounds and all external things are
merely dreams that the demon has contrived as traps for my
judgment. I shall consider myself as having no hands or eyes,
or flesh, or blood or senses, but as having falsely believed
that I had all these things. I shall stubbornly persist in this
train of thought; and even if I can’t learn any truth, I shall at
least do what I can do, which is to be on my guard against
accepting any falsehoods, so that the deceiver—however
powerful and cunning he may be—will be unable to affect me
in the slightest. This will be hard work, though, and a kind
of laziness pulls me back into my old ways. Like a prisoner
who dreams that he is free, starts to suspect that it is merely
a dream, and wants to go on dreaming rather than waking
up, so I am content to slide back into my old opinions; I
fear being shaken out of them because I am afraid that my
peaceful sleep may be followed by hard labour when I wake,
and that I shall have to struggle not in the light but in the
imprisoning darkness of the problems I have raised.
Second Meditation:
The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than the body
Yesterday’s meditation raised doubts—ones that are too
serious to be ignored—which I can see no way of resolving.
I feel like someone who is suddenly dropped into a deep
whirlpool that tumbles him around so that he can neither
stand on the bottom nor swim to the top. However, I shall
force my way up, and try once more to carry out the project
3
Meditations René Descartes Second Meditation
that I started on yesterday. I will set aside anything that
admits of the slightest doubt, treating it as though I had
found it to be outright false; and I will carry on like that until
I find something certain, or—at worst—until I become certain
that there is no certainty. Archimedes said that if he had
one firm and immovable point he could lift the world ·with
a long enough lever·; so I too can hope for great things if I
manage to find just one little thing that is solid and certain.
I will suppose, then, that everything I see is fictitious. I
will believe that my memory tells me nothing but lies. I have
no senses. Body, shape, extension, movement and place are
illusions. So what remains true? Perhaps just the one fact
that nothing is certain!
[This paragraph is presented as a further to-and-fro argument between two people. Remember that this isn’t how Descartes wrote it.]
Hopeful: Still, how do I know that there isn’t something—
not on that list—about which there is no room for even the
slightest doubt? Isn’t there a God (call him what you will)
who gives me the thoughts I am now having?
Doubtful: But why do I think this, since I might myself
be the author of these thoughts?
Hopeful: But then doesn’t it follow that I am, at least,
something?
Doubtful: This is very confusing, because I have just said
that I have no senses and no body, and I am so bound up
with a body and with senses that one would think that I can’t
exist without them. Now that I have convinced myself that
there is nothing in the world—no sky, no earth, no minds,
no bodies—does it follow that I don’t exist either?
Hopeful: No it does not follow; for if I convinced myself
of something then I certainly existed.
Doubtful: But there is a supremely powerful and cunning
deceiver who deliberately deceives me all the time!
Hopeful: Even then, if he is deceiving me I undoubtedly
exist: let him deceive me all he can, he will never bring it
about that I am nothing while I think I am something. So
after thoroughly thinking the matter through I conclude that
this proposition, I am, I exist, must be true whenever I assert
it or think it.
But this ‘I’ that must exist—I still don’t properly understand what it is; so I am at risk of confusing it with something
else, thereby falling into error in the very item of knowledge
that I maintain is the most certain and obvious of all. To get
straight about what this ‘I’ is, I shall go back and think some
more about what I believed myself to be before I started this
meditation. I will eliminate from those beliefs anything that
could be even slightly called into question by the arguments I
have been using, which will leave me with only beliefs about
myself that are certain and unshakable.
Well, then, what did I think I was? A man. But what is a
man? Shall I say ‘a rational animal’? No; for then I should
have to ask what an animal is, and what rationality is—each
question would lead me on to other still harder ones, and
this would take more time than I can spare. Let me focus
instead on the beliefs that spontaneously and naturally came
to me whenever I thought about what I was. The first such
belief was that I had a face, hands, arms and the whole
structure of bodily parts that corpses also have—I call it the
body. The next belief was that I ate and drank, that I moved
about; and that I engaged in sense-perception and thinking,
which I thought were done by the soul. [In this work ‘the soul’
= ‘the mind’; it has no religious implications.] If I gave any thought
to what this soul was like, I imagined it to be something
thin and filmy— like a wind or fire or ether—permeating my
more solid parts. I was more sure about the body, though,
thinking that I knew exactly what sort of thing it was. If
I had tried to put my conception of the body into words, I
would have said this:
4
Meditations René Descartes Second Meditation
By a ‘body’ I understand whatever has a definite shape
and position, and can occupy a ·region of· space in
such a way as to keep every other body out of it; it can
be perceived by touch, sight, hearing, taste or smell,
and can be moved in various ways.
I would have added that a body can’t start up movements
by itself, and can move only through being moved by other
things that bump into it. It seemed to me quite out of
character for a body to be able to •initiate movements, or
to able to •sense and think, and I was amazed that certain
bodies—·namely, human ones·—could do those things.
But now that I am supposing there is a supremely powerful and malicious deceiver who has set out to trick me in
every way he can—now what shall I say that I am? Can I
now claim to have any of the features that I used to think
belong to a body? When I think about them really carefully,
I find that they are all open to doubt: I shan’t waste time
by showing this about each of them separately. Now, what
about the features that I attributed to the soul? Nutrition or
movement? Since now ·I am pretending that· I don’t have a
body, these are mere fictions. Sense-perception? One needs
a body in order to perceive; and, besides, when dreaming I
have seemed to perceive through the senses many things that
I later realized I had not perceived in that way. Thinking? At
last I have discovered it—thought! This is the one thing that
can’t be separated from me. I am, I exist—that is certain.
But for how long? For as long as I am thinking. But perhaps
no longer than that; for it might be that if I stopped thinking
I would stop existing; and ·I have to treat that possibility as
though it were actual, because· my present policy is to reject
everything that isn’t necessarily true. Strictly speaking, then,
I am simply a thing that thinks—a mind, or soul, or intellect,
or reason, these being words whose meaning I have only just
come to know. Still, I am a real, existing thing. What kind of
a thing? I have answered that: a thinking thing.
What else am I? I will use my imagination to see if I am
anything more. I am not that structure of limbs and organs
that is called a human body; nor am I a thin vapour that
permeates the limbs—a wind, fire, air, breath, or whatever I
imagine; for I have supposed all these things to be nothing
·because I have supposed all bodies to be nothing·. Even if
I go on supposing them to be nothing, I am still something.
But these things that I suppose to be nothing because they
are unknown to me—might they not in fact be identical with
the I of which I am aware? I don’t know; and just now I
shan’t discuss the matter, because I can form opinions only
about things that I know. I know that I exist, and I am
asking: what is this I that I know? My knowledge of it can’t
depend on things of whose existence I am still unaware; so
it can’t depend on anything that I invent in my imagination.
The word ‘invent’ points to what is wrong with relying on
my imagination in this matter: if I used imagination to show
that I was something or other, that would be mere invention,
mere story-telling; for imagining is simply contemplating
the shape or image of a bodily thing. [Descartes here relies
on a theory of his about the psychology of imagination.] That makes
imagination suspect, for while I know for sure that I exist, I
know that everything relating to the nature of body ·including
imagination· could be mere dreams; so it would be silly
for me to say ‘I will use my imagination to get a clearer
understanding of what I am’—as silly, indeed, as to say ‘I
am now awake, and see some truth; but I shall deliberately
fall asleep so as to see even more, and more truly, in my
dreams’! If my mind is to get a clear understanding of its
own nature, it had better not look to the imagination for it.
Well, then, what am I? A thing that thinks. What is that?
A thing that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wants,
refuses, and also imagines and senses.
5
Meditations René Descartes Second Meditation
That is a long list of attributes for me to have—and it
really is I who have them all. Why should it not be? Isn’t it
one and the same ‘I’ who now
doubts almost everything,
understands some things,
affirms this one thing—·namely, that I exist and think·,
denies everything else,
wants to know more,
refuses to be deceived,
imagines many things involuntarily, and
is aware of others that seem to come from the senses?
Isn’t all this just as true as the fact that I exist, even if I am
in a perpetual dream, and even if my creator is doing his best
to deceive me? Which of all these activities is distinct from
my thinking? Which of them can be said to be separate from
myself? The fact that it is I who doubt and understand and
want is so obvious that I can’t see how to make it any clearer.
But the ‘I’ who imagines is also this same ‘I’. For even if (as I
am pretending) none of the things that I imagine really exist,
I really do imagine them, and this is part of my thinking.
Lastly, it is also this same ‘I’ who senses, or is aware of
bodily things seemingly through the senses. Because I may
be dreaming, I can’t say for sure that I now see the flames,
hear the wood crackling, and feel the heat of the fire; but
I certainly seem to see, to hear, and to be warmed. This
cannot be false; what is called ‘sensing’ is strictly just this
seeming, and when ‘sensing’ is understood in this restricted
sense of the word it too is simply thinking.
All this is starting to give me a better understanding
of what I am. But I still can’t help thinking that bodies—
of which I form mental images and which the senses
investigate—are much more clearly known to me than is
this puzzling ‘I’ that can’t be pictured in the imagination.
It would be surprising if this were right, though; for it
would be surprising if I had a clearer grasp of things that I
realize are doubtful, unknown and foreign to me—·namely,
bodies·—than I have of what is true and known— namely
my own self. But I see what the trouble is: I keep drifting
towards that error because my mind likes to wander freely,
refusing to respect the boundaries that truth lays down. Very
well, then; I shall let it run free for a while, so that when
the time comes to rein it in it won’t be so resistant to being
pulled back.
Let us consider the things that people ordinarily think
they understand best of all, namely the bodies that we touch
and see. I don’t mean bodies in general—for our general
thoughts are apt to be confused—but one particular body:
this piece of wax, for example. It has just been taken from
the honeycomb; it still tastes of honey and has the scent of
the flowers from which the honey was gathered; its colour,
shape and size are plain to see; it is hard, cold and can be
handled easily; if you rap it with your knuckle it makes a
sound. In short, it has everything that seems to be needed
for a body to be known perfectly clearly. But as I speak these
words I hold the wax near to the fire, and look! The taste and
smell vanish, the colour changes, the shape is lost, the size
increases; the wax becomes liquid and hot; you can hardly
touch it, and it no longer makes a sound when you strike it.
But is it still the same wax? Of course it is; no-one denies
this. So what was it about the wax that I understood so
clearly? Evidently it was not any of the features that the
senses told me of; for all of them— brought to me through
taste, smell, sight, touch or hearing—have now altered, yet
it is still the same wax.
Perhaps what I now think about the wax indicates what
its nature was all along. If that is right, then the wax was
not the sweetness of the honey, the scent of the flowers, the
whiteness, the shape, or the sound, but was rather a body
6
Meditations René Descartes Second Meditation
that recently presented itself to me in those ways but now
appears differently. But what exactly is this thing that I
am now imagining? Well, if we take away whatever doesn’t
belong to the wax (·that is, everything that the wax could be
without·), what is left is merely something extended, flexible
and changeable. What do ‘flexible’ and ‘changeable’ mean
here? I can imaginatively picture this piece of wax changing
from round to square, from square to triangular, and so
on. But that isn’t what changeability is. In knowing that
the wax is changeable I understand that it can go through
endlessly many changes of that kind, far more than I can
depict in my imagination; so it isn’t my imagination that
gives me my grasp of the wax as flexible and changeable.
Also, what does ‘extended’ mean? Is the wax’s extension
also unknown? It increases if the wax melts, and increases
again if it boils; the wax can be extended in many more ways
(·that is, with many more shapes·) than I will ever bring
before my imagination. I am forced to conclude that the
nature of this piece of wax isn’t revealed by my imagination,
but is perceived by the mind alone. (I am speaking of •this
particular piece of wax; the point is even clearer with regard
to •wax in general.) This wax that is perceived by the mind
alone is, of course, the same wax that I see, touch, and
picture in my imagination—in short the same wax I thought
it to be from the start. But although my perception of it
seemed to be a case of vision and touch and imagination, it
isn’t so and it never was. Rather, it is purely a scrutiny by
the mind alone— formerly an imperfect and confused one,
but now vivid and clear because I am now concentrating
carefully on what the wax consists in.
As I reach this conclusion I am amazed at how prone to
error my mind is. For although I am thinking all this out
within myself, silently, I do it with the help of words, and
I am at risk of being led astray by them. When the wax is
in front of us, we say that we see it, not that we judge it to
be there from its colour or shape; and this might make me
think that knowledge of the wax comes from what the eye
sees rather than from the perception of the mind alone. But
·this is clearly wrong, as the following example shows·. If I
look out of the window and see men crossing the square, as
I have just done, I say that I see the men themselves, just
as I say that I see the wax; yet do I see any more than hats
and coats that could conceal robots? I judge that they are
men. Something that I thought I saw with my eyes, therefore,
was really grasped solely by my mind’s faculty of judgment
[= ‘ability or capacity to make judgments’].
However, someone who wants to know more than the
common crowd should be ashamed to base his doubts on
ordinary ways of talking. Let us push ahead, then, and
ask: When was my perception of the wax’s nature more
perfect and clear? Was it •when I first looked at the wax, and
thought I knew it through my senses? Or is it •now, after I
have enquired more carefully into the wax’s nature and into
how it is known? It would be absurd to hesitate in answering
the question; for what clarity and sharpness was there in
my earlier perception of the wax? Was there anything in it
that •a lower animal couldn’t have? But when I consider the
wax apart from its outward forms—take its clothes off, so to
speak, and consider it naked—then although my judgment
may still contain errors, at least I am now having a perception
of a sort that requires •a human mind.
But what am I to say about this mind, or about myself?
(So far, remember, I don’t admit that there is anything to me
except a mind.) What, I ask, is this ‘I’ that seems to perceive
the wax so clearly? Surely, I am aware of •my own self in a
truer and more certain way than I am of •the wax, and also
in a much more distinct and evident way. What leads me to
think that •the wax exists—namely, that I see it— leads much
7
Meditations René Descartes Second Meditation
more obviously to the conclusion that •I exist. What I see
might not really be the wax; perhaps I don’t even have eyes
with which to see anything. But when I see or think I see (I
am not here distinguishing the two), it is simply not possible
that I who am now thinking am not something. Similarly,
that •I exist follows from the other bases for judging that
•the wax exists - that I touch it, that I imagine it, or any
other basis—and similarly for my bases for judging that
anything else exists outside me. As I came to perceive the
wax more distinctly by applying not just sight and touch but
other considerations, all this too contributed to my knowing
myself even more distinctly, because whatever goes into my
perception of •the wax or of any other body must do even
more to establish the nature of •my own mind. What comes
to my mind from bodies, therefore, helps me to know my
mind distinctly; yet all of that pales into insignificance—it
is hardly worth mentioning—when compared with what
my mind contains within itself that enables me to know
it distinctly.
See! With no effort I have reached the place where I
wanted to be! I now know that even bodies are perceived not
by the senses or by imagination but by the intellect alone,
not through their being touched or seen but through their
being understood; and this helps me to know plainly that
I can perceive my own mind more easily and clearly than I
can anything else. Since the grip of old opinions is hard to
shake off, however, I want to pause and meditate for a while
on this new knowledge of mine, fixing it more deeply in my
memory.

Meditations René Descartes Third Meditation
Third Meditation:
God
[Before we move on, a translation matter should be confronted. It concerns the Latin adjectives
clarus and distinctus
the corresponding French adjectives
clair and distinct
and the corresponding English adjectives
‘vivid’ and ‘clear’.
Every other translator of this work into English has put
‘clear’ and ‘distinct’
and for a while the present translator in cowardly fashion followed suit.
But the usual translation is simply wrong, and we ought to free ourselves
from it. The crucial point concerns clarus (and everything said about that
here is equally true of the French clair). The word can mean ‘clear’ in our
sense, and when Descartes uses it outside the clarus et distinctus phrase,
it seems usually to be in that sense. But in that phrase he uses clarus
in its other meaning—its more common meaning in Latin—of ‘bright’ or
‘vivid’ or the like, as in clara lux = ‘broad daylight’. If in the phrase clarus
et distinctus Descartes meant clarus in its lesser meaning of ‘clear’, then
what is there left for ‘distinctus’ to mean? Descartes doesn’t explain
these terms here, but in his Principles of Philosophy 1:45–6 he does
so—in a manner that completely condemns the usual translation. He
writes: ‘I call a perception claram when it is present and accessible to
the attentive mind—just as we say that we see something clare when
it is present to the eye’s gaze and stimulates it with a sufficient degree
of strength and accessibility. I call a perception distinctam if, as well
as being clara, it is so sharply separated from all other perceptions that
every part of it is clarum.. . . . The example of pain shows that a perception
can be clara without being distincta but not vice versa. When for example
someone feels an intense pain, his perception of it is clarissima, but it
isn’t always clear, because people often get this perception muddled with
an obscure judgment they make about something that they think exists
in the painful spot. . . .’ and so on. Of course he is not saying anything
as stupid as that intense pain is always clear! His point is that pain is
vivid, up-front, not shady or obscure. And for an idea to be distincta is
for every nook and cranny of it to be vivid; which is not a bad way of
saying that it is in our sense ‘clear’.]
I will now shut my eyes, block my ears, cut off all my
senses. I will regard all my mental images of bodily things
as empty, false and worthless (if I could, I would clear them
out of my mind altogether). I will get into conversation with
myself, examine myself more deeply, and try in this way
gradually to know myself more intimately. I am a thing
that thinks, i.e that doubts, affirms, denies, understands
some things, is ignorant of many others, wills, and refuses.
This thing also imagines and has sensory perceptions; for,
as I remarked before, even if the objects of my sensory
experience and imagination don’t exist outside me, still
sensory perception and imagination themselves, considered
simply as mental events, certainly do occur in me.
That lists everything that I truly know, or at least everything I have, up to now, discovered that I know. Now I will
look more carefully to see whether I have overlooked other
facts about myself. I am certain that I am a thinking thing.
Doesn’t that tell me what it takes for me to be certain about
anything? In this first item of knowledge there is simply
a vivid and clear perception of what I am asserting; this
wouldn’t be enough to make me certain of its truth if it could
ever turn out that something that I perceived so vividly and
clearly was false. So I now seem to be able to lay it down as a
general rule that whatever I perceive very vividly and clearly
is true.
9
Meditations René Descartes Third Meditation
I previously accepted as perfectly certain and evident
many things that I afterwards realized were doubtful—the
earth, sky, stars, and everything else that I took in through
the senses—but in those cases what I perceived clearly were
merely the ideas or thoughts of those things that came into
my mind; and I am still not denying that those ideas occur
within me. But I used also to believe that my ideas came from
things outside that resembled them in all respects. Indeed, I
believed this for so long that I wrongly came to think that I
perceived it clearly. In fact, it was false; or anyway if it was
true it was not thanks to the strength of my perceptions.
But what about when I was considering something simple
and straightforward in arithmetic or geometry, for example
that two plus three makes five? Didn’t I see these things
clearly enough to accept them as true? Indeed, the only
reason I could find for doubting them was this: Perhaps
some God could have made me so as to be deceived even in
those matters that seemed most obvious. Whenever I bring
to mind my old belief in the supreme power of God, I have
to admit that God could, if he wanted to, easily make me go
wrong even about things that I think I see perfectly clearly.
But when I turn my thought onto the things themselves—the
ones I think I perceive clearly—I find them so convincing that
I spontaneously exclaim: ‘Let him do his best to deceive me!
He will never bring it about that I am nothing while I think
I am something; or make it true in the future that I have
never existed, given that I do now exist; or bring it about
that two plus three make more or less than five, or anything
else like this in which I see a plain contradiction.’ Also, since
I have no evidence that there is a deceiving God, and don’t
even know for sure that there is a God at all, the reason for
doubt based purely on this supposition of a deceiving God
is a very slight and theoretical one. However, I shall want to
remove even this slight reason for doubt; so when I get the
opportunity I shall examine whether there is a God, and (if
there is) whether he can be a deceiver. If I don’t settle this, it
seems, then I can never be quite certain about anything else.
First, if I am to proceed in an orderly way I should classify
my thoughts into definite kinds, and ask which kinds can
properly be said to be true or false. Some of my thoughts are,
so to speak, images or pictures of things—as when I think of
a man, or a chimera, or the sky, or an angel, or God— and
strictly speaking these are the only thoughts that should be
called ‘ideas’. Other thoughts have more to them than that:
for example when I will, or am afraid, or affirm, or deny, my
thought represents some particular thing but it also includes
something more than merely the likeness of that thing. Some
thoughts in this category are called volitions or emotions,
while others are called judgments.
When ideas are considered solely in themselves and not
taken to be connected to anything else, they can’t be false;
for whether it is •a goat that I am imagining or •a chimera,
either way it is true that I do imagine it. Nor is there falsity
in the will or the emotions; for even if the things I want are
wicked or non-existent, it is still true that I want them. All
that is left—the only kind of thought where I must watch out
for mistakes—are judgments. And the mistake they most
commonly involve is to judge that my ideas resemble things
outside me. Of course, if I considered the ideas themselves
simply as aspects of my thought and not as connected to
anything else, they could hardly lead me into any error.
Among my ideas, some seem to be •innate, some to be
•caused from the outside, and others to have been •invented
by me. As I see it, •my understanding of what a thing is,
what truth is, and what thought is, derives purely from my
own nature, ·which means that it is innate·; •my hearing a
noise or seeing the sun or feeling the fire comes from things
outside me; and •sirens, hippogriffs and the like are my own
10
Meditations René Descartes Third Meditation
invention. But perhaps really all my ideas are caused from
the outside, or all are innate, or all are made up; for I still
have not clearly perceived their true origin.
But my main question now concerns the ideas that I
take to come from things outside me: why do I think they
resemble these things? Nature has apparently taught me
to think that they do. But also I know from experience that
these ideas don’t depend on my will, and thus don’t depend
simply on me. They often come into my mind without my
willing them to: right now, for example, I have a feeling of
warmth, whether I want to or not, and that leads me to think
that this sensation or idea of heat comes from something
other than myself, namely the heat of a fire by which I am
sitting. And it seems natural to suppose that what comes to
me from that external thing will be like it rather than unlike
it.
Now let me see if these arguments are strong enough.
When I say ‘Nature taught me to think this’, all I mean is
that •I have a spontaneous impulse to believe it, not that
•I am shown its truth by some natural light. There is a
great difference between those. Things that are revealed by
the natural light—for example, that if I am doubting then I
exist—are not open to any doubt, because no other faculty
that might show them to be false could be as trustworthy
as the natural light. My natural impulses, however, have
no such privilege: I have often come to think that they had
pushed me the wrong way on moral questions, and I don’t
see any reason to trust them in other things.
Then again, although these ideas don’t depend on my will,
it doesn’t follow that they must come from things located
outside me. Perhaps they come from some faculty of mine
other than my will—one that I don’t fully know about—which
produces these ideas without help from external things;
this is, after all, just how I have always thought ideas are
produced in me when I am dreaming. Similarly, the natural
impulses that I have been talking about, though they seem
opposed to my will, come from within me; ·which provides
evidence that I can cause things that my will does not cause·.
Finally, even if these ideas do come from things other
than myself, it doesn’t follow that they must resemble those
things. Indeed, I think I have often discovered objects to be
very unlike my ideas of them. For example, I find within
me two different ideas of the sun: •one seems to come from
the senses—it is a prime example of an idea that I reckon to
have an external source—and it makes the sun appear very
small; •the other is based on astronomical reasoning—i.e.
it is based on notions that are innate in me (or else it is
constructed by me in some other way)—and it shows the
sun to be many times larger than the earth. Obviously these
ideas cannot both resemble the external sun; and reason
convinces me that the idea that seems to have come most
directly from the sun itself in fact does not resemble it at all.
These considerations show that it isn’t reliable judgment
but merely some blind impulse that has led me to think that
there exist outside me things that give ideas or images [=
‘likenesses’] of themselves through the sense organs or in some
other way.
Perhaps, though, there is another way of investigating
whether some of the things of which I have ideas really
do exist outside me. Considered simply as mental events,
my ideas seem to be all on a par: they all appear to come
from inside me in the same way. But considered as images
representing things other than themselves, it is clear that
they differ widely. Undoubtedly, the •ideas that represent
substances amount to something more—they contain within
themselves more representative reality—than do the •ideas
that merely represent modes [= ‘qualities’]. Again, the •idea
that gives me my understanding of a supreme God—eternal,
11
Meditations René Descartes Third Meditation
infinite, unchangeable, omniscient, omnipotent and the
creator of everything that exists except for himself—certainly
has in it more representative reality than the •ideas that
represent merely finite substances.
Now it is obvious by the natural light that the total cause
of something must contain at least as much reality as does
the effect. For where could the effect get its reality from if
not from the cause? And how could the cause give reality to
the effect unless it first had that reality itself? Two things
follow from this: that something can’t arise from nothing,
and that what is more perfect—that is, contains in itself
more reality—can’t arise from what is less perfect. And this
is plainly true not only for ‘actual’ or ‘intrinsic’ reality (as
philosophers call it) but also for the representative reality of
ideas—that is, the reality that a idea represents. A stone,
for example, can begin to exist only if it is produced by
something that contains—either straightforwardly or in some
higher form—everything that is to be found in the stone;
similarly, heat can’t be produced in a previously cold object
except by something of at least the same order of perfection
as heat, and so on. (·I don’t say simply ‘except by something
that is hot’, because that is not necessary. The thing
could be caused to be hot by something that doesn’t itself
straightforwardly contain heat—i.e. that isn’t itself hot— but
contains heat in a higher form, that is, something of a higher
order of perfection than heat. Thus, for example, although
God is obviously not himself hot, he can cause something to
be hot because he contains heat not straightforwardly but in
a higher form·.) But it is also true that the idea of heat or of
a stone can be caused in me only by something that contains
at least as much reality as I conceive to be in the heat or
in the stone. For although this cause does not transfer any
of its actual or intrinsic reality to my idea, it still can’t be
less real. An idea need have no intrinsic reality except what
it derives from my thought, of which it is a mode. But any
idea that has representative reality must surely come from
a cause that contains at least as much intrinsic reality as
there is representative reality in the idea. For if we suppose
that an idea contains something that was not in its cause, it
must have got this from nothing; yet the kind of reality that
is involved in something’s being represented in the mind by
an idea, though it may not be very perfect, certainly isn’t
nothing, and so it can’t come from nothing.
It might be thought that since the reality that I am
considering in my ideas is merely representative, it might
be possessed by its cause only representatively and not
intrinsically. ·That would mean that the cause is itself
an idea, because only ideas have representative reality·.
But that would be wrong. Although one idea may perhaps
originate from another, there can’t be an infinite regress
of such ideas; eventually one must come back to an idea
whose cause isn’t an idea, and this cause must be a kind
of archetype [= ‘pattern or model, from which copies are made’] containing intrinsically all the reality or perfection that the idea
contains only representatively. So the natural light makes it
clear to me that my ideas are like pictures or images that can
easily •fall short of the perfection of the things from which
they are taken, but which can’t •exceed it.
The longer and more carefully I examine all these points,
the more vividly and clearly I recognize their truth. But what
is my conclusion to be? If I find that
•some idea of mine has so much representative reality
that I am sure the same reality doesn’t reside in me,
either straightforwardly or in a higher form, and hence
that I myself can’t be the cause of the idea,
then, ·because everything must have some cause·, it will
necessarily follow that
12
Meditations René Descartes Third Meditation
•I am not alone in the world: there exists some other
thing that is the cause of that idea.
If no such idea is to be found in me, I shall have no argument
to show that anything exists apart from myself; for, despite
a most careful and wide-ranging survey, this is the only
argument I have so far been able to find.
Among my ideas, apart from the one that gives me a
representation of myself, which can’t present any difficulty
in this context, there are ideas that variously represent God,
inanimate bodies, angels, animals and finally other men like
myself.
As regards my ideas of other men, or animals, or angels,
I can easily understand that they could be put together from
the ideas I have of myself, of bodies and of God, even if the
world contained no men besides me, no animals and no
angels.
As to my ideas of bodies, so far as I can see they contain
nothing that is so great or excellent that it couldn’t have
originated in myself. For if I examine them thoroughly, one
by one, as I did the idea of the wax yesterday, I realize that
the following short list gives everything that I perceive vividly
and clearly in them:
•size, or extension in length, breadth and depth;
•shape, which is a function of the boundaries of this
extension;
•position, which is a relation between various items
possessing shape;
• motion, or change in position.
To these may be added
•substance, duration and number.
But as for all the rest, including light and colours, sounds,
smells, tastes, heat and cold and the other qualities that can
be known by touch, I think of these in such a confused and
obscure way that I don’t even know whether they are true
or false, that is, whether my ideas of them are ideas of real
things or of non-things. Strictly speaking, only judgments
can be true or false; but we can also speak of an idea as
‘false’ in a certain sense—we call it ‘materially false’—if it
represents a non-thing as a thing. For example, my ideas of
heat and cold have so little clarity and distinctness that they
don’t enable me to know whether
•cold is merely the absence of heat, or
•heat is merely the absence of cold, or
•heat and cold are both real ·positive· qualities, or
•neither heat nor cold is a real ·positive· quality.
If the right answer is that cold is nothing but the absence of
heat, the idea that represents it to me as something real and
positive deserves to be called ‘false’; and the same goes for
other ideas of this kind.
Such ideas obviously don’t have to be caused by something other than myself. •If they are false—that is, if they
represent non-things—then they are in me only because of
a deficiency or lack of perfection in my nature, which is to
say that they arise from nothing; I know this by the natural
light. •If on the other hand they are true, there is no reason
why they shouldn’t arise from myself, since they represent
such a slight reality that I can’t even distinguish it from a
non-thing.
With regard to the vivid and clear elements in my ideas of
bodies, it appears that I could have borrowed some of these
from my idea of myself, namely substance, duration, number
and anything else of this kind. For example, I think that a
stone is a substance, or is a thing capable of existing independently, and I also think that I am a substance. Admittedly I
conceive of myself as a thing that thinks and isn’t extended,
and of the stone as a thing that is extended and doesn’t
think, so that the two conceptions differ enormously; but
13
Meditations René Descartes Third Meditation
they seem to have the classification ‘substance’ in common.
Again, I perceive that I now exist, and remember that I have
existed •for some time; moreover, I have various thoughts
that I can •count; it is in these ways that I acquire the ideas
of •duration and •number that I can then transfer to other
things. As for all the other elements that make up the ideas
of bodies— extension, shape, position and movement—these
are not straightforwardly contained in me, since I am nothing
but a thinking thing; but since they are merely modes of
a substance, and I am a substance, it seems possible that
they are contained in me in some higher form. ·That is, I
am not myself extended, shaped etc., but because I am a
substance I am (so to speak) metaphysically one up on these
mere modes, which implies that I can contain within me
whatever it takes to cause the ideas of them·.
So there remains only the idea of God: is there anything in that which couldn’t have originated in myself? By
the word ‘God’ I understand a substance that is infinite,
eternal, unchangeable, independent, supremely intelligent,
supremely powerful, which created myself and anything else
that may exist. The more carefully I concentrate on these
attributes, the less possible it seems that any of them could
have originated from me alone. So this whole discussion
implies that God necessarily exists.
It is true that my being a substance explains my having
the idea of substance; but it does not explain my having the
idea of an infinite substance. That must come from some
substance that is itself infinite. I am finite.
It might be thought that ·this is wrong, because· my
notion of the •infinite is arrived at merely by negating the
•finite, just as my conceptions of •rest and •darkness are
arrived at by negating •movement and •light. ·That would
be a mistake, however·. I clearly understand that there is
more reality in an infinite substance than in a finite one,
and hence that my perception of the infinite, i.e. God, is in
some way prior to my perception of the finite, i.e. myself.
Whenever I know that I doubt something or want something,
I understand that I lack something and am therefore not
wholly perfect. How could I grasp this unless I had an idea
of a more perfect being that enabled me to recognize my own
defects by comparison?
Nor can it be said that this idea of God could be ‘materially
false’, and thus have come from nothing, as may be the case
(I noted this a few moments ago) with the ideas of heat
and cold. On the contrary, it is utterly vivid and clear, and
contains in itself more representative reality than any other
idea; ·that is, it stands for something that is grander, more
powerful, more real, than any other idea stands for·; so it
is more true—less open to the suspicion of falsehood—than
any other idea. This idea of a supremely perfect and infinite
being is, I say, true in the highest degree; for although one
might imagine that such a being does not exist, it can’t be
supposed that the idea of such a being represents something
unreal in the way that the idea of cold perhaps does. The
idea is, moreover, utterly vivid and clear. It does not matter
that I don’t grasp the infinite, or that there are countless
additional attributes of God that I can’t grasp and perhaps
can’t even touch in my thought; for it is in the nature of the
infinite not to be grasped by a finite being like myself. It is
enough that I understand the infinite, and that I judge that
all the attributes that I clearly perceive and know to imply
some perfection—and perhaps countless others of which I
am ignorant—are present in God either straightforwardly or
in some higher form. This is enough to make the idea that
I have of God the truest and most vivid and clear of all my
ideas.
·Here is a possible objection to that line of thought·.
Perhaps I am greater than I myself understand: perhaps
14
Meditations René Descartes Third Meditation
all the perfections that I attribute to God are ones that I do
have in some potential form, and they merely haven’t yet
shown themselves in actuality. My knowledge is gradually
increasing, and I see no obstacle to its going on increasing to
infinity. I might then be able to use this increased ·and eventually infinite· knowledge to acquire all the other perfections
of God. In that case, I already have the potentiality for these
perfections—why shouldn’t this ·potentiality· be enough to
enable me to have caused the idea of them ·that is, to have
caused my idea of God·?
But all this [that is, the whole of the preceding paragraph] is
impossible ·for three reasons·. •First, though it is true that
my knowledge is increasing, and that I have many potentialities that are not yet actual, this is all quite irrelevant to
the idea of God, which contains absolutely nothing that is
potential. Indeed, this gradual increase in knowledge is itself
the surest sign of imperfection, ·because if I am learning
more, that shows that there are things I don’t know, and
that is an imperfection in me·. •What is more, even if my
knowledge increases for ever, it will never actually be infinite,
since it will never reach the point where it isn’t capable of a
further increase; God, on the other hand, I take to be actually
infinite, so that nothing can be added to his perfection. •And,
thirdly, strictly speaking potential being is nothing; what it
takes to cause the representative being of an idea is actual
being.
If one concentrates carefully, all this is quite evident by
the natural light. But when I relax my concentration, and my
mental vision is blurred by the images of things I perceive
by the senses, I lose sight of the reasons why my idea of
more perfect being has to come from a being that really is
more perfect. So I want to push on with my enquiry, now
asking a new question: If the more perfect being didn’t exist,
could I exist? ·My hope is that the answer to this will yield a
new proof of the existence of a perfect being—a proof that it
will be easier for me to keep in mind even when I relax my
concentration·.
Well, if God didn’t exist, from what would I derive my
existence? It would have to come from myself, or from my
parents, or from some other beings less perfect than God
(a being more perfect than God, or even one as perfect, is
unthinkable).
If I had derived my existence from myself, I would not
now doubt or want or lack anything at all; for I would have
given myself all the perfections of which I have any idea. So I
would be God. I mustn’t suppose that the items I lack would
be harder to get than the ones I now have. On the contrary,
it would have been far more difficult for me—a thinking
thing or substance—to emerge out of nothing than merely
to acquire knowledge of the many things I’m ignorant about,
because that would merely be giving the substance certain
accidents. If I had derived my existence from myself—the
greater achievement—I certainly wouldn’t have denied myself
the knowledge in question, which is something much easier
to acquire, or indeed any of the attributes that I perceive to
be contained in the idea of God; for none of them seem any
harder to achieve. . . .
Here is a thought that might seem to undercut that
argument. Perhaps I have always existed as I do now.
Then wouldn’t it follow that there need be no cause for my
existence? No, it does not follow. For a life-span can be
divided into countless parts, each completely independent
of the others, so that from my existing at one time it doesn’t
follow that I exist at later times, unless some cause keeps
me in existence—one might say that it creates me afresh at
each moment. Anyone who thinks hard about the nature of
time will understand that what it takes to •bring a thing into
existence is also needed to •keep it in existence at each mo15
Meditations René Descartes Third Meditation
ment of its duration. So there’s no real distinction between
•preservation and •creation—only a conceptual one—and this
is something that the natural light makes evident.
So I have to ask myself whether I have the power to bring
it about that I, who now exist, will still exist a minute from
now. For since I am nothing but a thinking thing—or anyway
that is the only part of me that I am now concerned with—if
I had such a power I would undoubtedly be aware of it. But
I experience no such power, and this shows me quite clearly
that I depend ·for my continued existence· on some being
other than myself.
Perhaps this being is not God, though. Perhaps I was
produced by causes less perfect than God, such as my
parents. No; for as I have said before, it is quite clear
that there must be at least as much reality or perfection
in the cause as in the effect. And therefore, given that I
am a thinking thing and have within me some idea of God,
the cause of me—whatever it is—must itself be a thinking
thing and must have the idea of all the perfections that I
attribute to God. What is the cause of this cause of me?
If it is the cause of its own existence, then it is God; for if
it has the power of existing through its own strength, then
undoubtedly it also has the power of actually possessing
all the perfections of which it has an idea—that is, all the
perfections that I conceive to be in God. If on the other hand
it gets its existence from another cause, then the question
arises all over again regarding this further cause: Does it get
its existence from itself or from another cause? Eventually
we must reach the ultimate cause, and this will be God.
It is clear enough that this sequence of causes of causes
can’t run back to infinity, especially since I am dealing with
the cause that not only produced me in the past but also
preserves me at the present moment.
One might think this:
Several partial causes contributed to my creation;
I received the idea of one of the perfections that I
attribute to God from one cause, and the idea of
another from another. Each perfection is to be found
somewhere in the universe, but no one thing has them
all.
That can’t be right, because God’s simplicity—that is, the
unity or inseparability of all his attributes—is one of the
most important of the perfections that I understand him
to have. The idea of his perfections as united in a single
substance couldn’t have been placed in me by any cause
that didn’t also provide me with the ideas of the perfections
themselves; for no cause could have made me understand
that the perfections are united without at the same time
showing me what they are.
Lastly, as regards my parents, even if everything I have
ever believed about them is true, it is certainly not they
who keep me in existence. Insofar as I am a thinking thing,
indeed, they did not even make me; they merely brought
about an arrangement of matter that I have always regarded
as containing me (that is, containing my mind, for that is
all I now take myself to be). So my parents can’t be the
cause-of-me that I am enquiring about.
·Given the failure of every other candidacy for the role
of cause of me and of my idea of a most perfect being, I
infer that the only successful candidacy is God’s·. Thus,
I conclude that the mere fact that I exist and have within
me an idea of a most perfect being—that is, God—provides a
clear proof that God does indeed exist.
It remains for me only to ask how I received this idea from
God. I didn’t get it from the senses: it has never come to me
unexpectedly, as do most of the ideas that occur when I seem
to see and touch and hear things. And it’s not something that
16
Meditations René Descartes Fourth Meditation
I invented, either; for clearly I can’t take anything away from
it or add anything to it. ·When an idea is sheerly invented,
the inventor is free to fiddle with it—add a bit here, subtract
a bit there—whereas my idea of God is a natural unit that
doesn’t invite or even permit such interference·. The only
remaining alternative is that my idea of God is innate in me,
just as the idea of myself is innate in me.
It is no surprise that God in creating me should have
placed this idea in me, to serve as a mark of the craftsman
stamped on his work. The mark need not be anything distinct
from the work itself. But the mere fact that God created me
makes it very believable that I am somehow made in his
image and likeness, and that I perceive that likeness in the
same way that I perceive myself. That is, when I turn my
mind’s eye upon myself, I understand that I am a thing that
•is incomplete and •dependent on something else, and that
•aspires without limit to ever greater and better things; but I
also understand at the same time that he on whom I depend
has within him all those greater things—not just indefinitely
but infinitely, not just potentially but actually—and hence
that he is God. The core of the argument is this: I couldn’t
exist with the nature that I have—that is, containing within
me the idea of God—if God didn’t really exist. By ‘God’ I
mean the very being the idea of whom is within me—the one
that has no defects and has all those perfections that I can’t
grasp but can somehow touch with my thought. This shows
clearly that it is not possible for him to be a deceiver, since
the natural light makes it clear that all fraud and deception
depend on some defect.
But before examining this point more carefully and investigating other truths that may be derived from it, I want
to pause here and spend some time contemplating God;
to reflect on his attributes and to gaze with wonder and
adoration on the beauty of this immense light, so far as the
eye of my darkened intellect can bear it. For just as we
believe through faith that the supreme happiness of •the
next life consists in contemplating the divine majesty, so
experience tells us that this same contemplation, though
much less perfect, provides the greatest joy we can have in
•this life.
Fourth Meditation:
Truth and falsity
In these past few days I have become used to keeping
my mind away from the senses; and I have become strongly
aware that very little is truly known about bodies, whereas
much more is known about the human mind and still more
about God. So now I find it easy to turn my mind away from
objects of the senses and the imagination, towards objects
of the intellect alone; these are quite separate from matter,
·whereas the objects of sense and imagination are mostly
made of matter·. Indeed, none of my ideas of corporeal [=
‘bodily’] things is as distinct as my idea of the human mind,
17
Meditations René Descartes Fourth Meditation
considered purely as a thinking thing with no size or shape
or other bodily characteristics. Now, when I consider the fact
that I have doubts—which means that I am incomplete and
dependent—that leads to my having a vivid and clear idea of
a being who is independent and complete, that is, an idea of
God. And from the mere fact that •I exist and have such an
idea, I infer that •God exists and that every moment of my
existence depends on him. This follows clearly; I am sure,
indeed, that the human intellect can’t know anything that is
more evident or more certain. And now that I can take into
account the true God, in whom all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge lie hidden, I think I can see a way through to
knowledge of other things in the universe.
To begin with, I see that it is impossible that God should
ever deceive me. Only someone who has something wrong
with him will engage in trickery or deception. That someone
is able to deceive others may be a sign of his skill or power,
but his wanting to deceive them is a sign of his malice or
weakness; and those are not to be found in God.
Next, I know from experience that I have a faculty of
judgment; and this, like everything else I have, was given to
me by God. Since God doesn’t want to deceive me, I am sure
that he didn’t give me a faculty of judgment that would lead
me into error while I was using it correctly.
That would settle the matter, except for one difficulty:
what I have just said seems to imply that I can never be in
error. If everything that is in me comes from God, and he
didn’t equip me with a capacity for making mistakes, doesn’t
it follow that I can never go wrong in my beliefs? Well, I know
by experience that I am greatly given to errors; but when I
focus on God to the exclusion of everything else, I find in
him no cause of error or falsity. In looking for the cause of
my errors, I am helped by this thought: as well as having
a real and positive idea of God (a being who is supremely
perfect), I also have what you might call a negative idea
of nothingness (that which is furthest from all perfection). I
realize that I am somewhere in between God and nothingness,
or between supreme being and non-being. Now, the positive
reality that I have been given by the supreme being contains
nothing that could lead me astray in my beliefs. I make
mistakes, not surprisingly, because my nature involves
nothingness or non-being—that is, because I am not myself
the supreme being, and lack countless perfections. So error
is not something real that depends on God, but is merely
·something negative, a lack·, a defect. There is, therefore,
nothing positively error-producing in the faculty of judgment
that God gave me. When I go wrong I do so because the
faculty of true judgment that I have from God is in my case
not free of all limitations, ·that is, because it partly involves
nothingness·.
That is still not quite right. For error isn’t a mere negation.
·Pebbles and glaciers lack knowledge, and in them that lack
is a mere negation—the absence of something that there is
no reason for them to possess. I have lacks of that kind
too, mere negations such my lack of the ability to fly, or to
multiply two 30-digit prime numbers in my head. But my
tendency to error isn’t like that·. Rather, it is a privation,
that is, a lack of some knowledge that I should have, ·which
means that I still have a problem about how it relates to God·.
When I think hard about God, it seems impossible that he
should have given me a faculty that lacks some perfection
that it should have. The more skilled the craftsman, the
more perfect the thing that he makes; so one would expect
something made by the supreme creator to be complete and
perfect in every way. It is clear, furthermore, that God could
have made me in such a way that I was never mistaken; and
there is no doubt that he always chooses to do what is best.
Does this show that my making mistakes is better than my
18
Meditations René Descartes Fourth Meditation
not doing so?
Thinking harder about this, ·three helpful thoughts come
to me. Two concern our knowledge of God’s reasons generally; the third is specifically about human error·. (1) I
realize that it is no cause for surprise if I don’t always
understand why God acts as he does. I may well find other
things he has done whose reasons elude me; and that is
no reason to doubt his existence. I am now aware that my
nature is very weak and limited, whereas God’s nature is
immense, incomprehensible and infinite; so of course he can
do countless things whose reasons I can’t know. That alone
is reason enough to give up, as totally useless, the attempt
that physicists make to understand the world in terms of
what things are for, ·that is, in terms of God’s purposes·.
Only a very rash man would think he could discover what
God’s impenetrable purposes are.
(2) In estimating whether God’s works are perfect, we
should look at the universe as a whole, not at created things
one by one. Something that might seem very imperfect if it
existed on its own has a function in relation to the rest of
the universe, and may be perfect when seen in that light.
My decision to doubt everything has left me sure of the
existence of only two things, God and myself; but when I
think about God’s immense power I have to admit that he
did or could have made many things in addition to myself,
so that there may be a universal scheme of things in which
I have a place. ·If that is so, then judgments about what is
perfect or imperfect in me should be made on the basis not
just of my intrinsic nature but also of my role or function in
the universe as a whole·.
(3) My errors are the only evidence I have that I am
imperfect. When I look more closely into these errors of
mine, I discover that they have two co-operating causes—my
faculty of knowledge and my faculty of choice or freedom of
the will. My errors, that is, depend on both (a) my intellect
and (b) my will. ·Let us consider these separately·. (a)
The intellect doesn’t affirm or deny anything; its role is
only to present me with ideas regarding which I can make
judgments; so strictly speaking it doesn’t involve any error
at all. There may be many existing things of which my
intellect gives me no ideas, but it isn’t strictly correct to
say that I am deprived of such ideas, as it would be if my
nature somehow entitled me to have them. I can give no
reason why God ought to have given me more ideas than
he did. Just because I understand someone to be a skilled
craftsman, I don’t infer that he ought to have put into each
of his works all the perfections he can give to some of them.
So all I can say is that there are some ideas that I don’t have;
this is a purely negative fact about me ·like the fact that I
can’t fly; it doesn’t mean that there is anything wrong with
my nature·. (b) I can’t complain that God gave me a will
or freedom of choice that isn’t extensive or perfect enough,
since I know by experience that will is entirely without limits.
My will is so perfect and so great that I can’t conceive of its
becoming even greater and more perfect; it is a striking fact
that this is true of •my will and not of •any other aspect of
my nature. I can easily see that my faculty of understanding
is finite, to put it mildly; and I immediately conceive of a
much greater •understanding—indeed, of a supremely great
and infinite one; and the fact that I can form such an idea
shows me that God actually has such an understanding.
Similarly, if I examine •memory and •imagination and the
rest, I discover that in my case these faculties are weak and
limited, while in God they are immeasurable. It is only the
will, or freedom of choice, which I experience as so great
that I can’t make sense of the idea of its being even greater:
indeed, my thought of myself as being somehow like God
depends primarily upon my will. God’s will is incomparably
19
Meditations René Descartes Fourth Meditation
greater than mine in two respects: •it is accompanied by,
and made firm and effective by, much more knowledge and
power than I have; and •it has far more objects than my will
does—·that is, God makes more choices and decisions than
I do. But these comparisons—having to do with •the amount
of knowledge that accompanies and helps the will, or with
•the number of states of affairs to which it is applied—do
not concern the will in itself, but rather its relations to
other things·. When the will is considered ·not relationally,
but· strictly in itself, God’s will does not seem any greater
than mine. The will is simply one’s ability to do or not do
something—to accept or reject a proposition, to pursue a
goal or avoid something. More accurately: the ·freedom of
the· will consists in the fact that when the intellect presents
us with a candidate for acceptance or denial, or for pursuit
or avoidance, we have no sense that we are pushed one way
or the other by any external force. I can be free without
being inclined both ways. Indeed, the more strongly I incline
in one direction the more free my choice is—if my inclination
comes from •natural knowledge (that is, from my seeing
clearly that reasons of truth and goodness point that way)
or from •divine grace (that is, from some mental disposition
that God has given me). Freedom is never lessened—indeed
it is increased and strengthened—by •natural knowledge and
•divine grace. When no reason inclines me in one direction
rather than another, I have a feeling of indifference—·that is,
of its not mattering which way I go·—and that is the poorest
kind of freedom. What it displays is freedom, considered not
as a perfection but rather as a lack of knowledge—a kind of
negation. If I always saw clearly what was true and good,
I should never have to spend time thinking about what to
believe or do; and then I would be wholly free although I was
never in a state of indifference.
So the power of willing that God has given me, being
extremely broad in its scope and also perfect of its kind, is not
the cause of my mistakes. Nor is my power of understanding
to blame: God gave it to me, so there can be no error in
its activities; when I understand something I undoubtedly
understand it correctly. Well, then, where do my mistakes
come from? Their source is the fact that my will has a wider
scope than my intellect has, ·so that I am free to form beliefs
on topics that I don’t understand·. Instead of ·behaving as I
ought to, namely by· restricting my will to the territory that
my understanding covers, ·that is, suspending judgment
when I am not intellectually in control·, I let my will run
loose, applying it to matters that I don’t understand. In such
cases there is nothing to stop the will from veering this way
or that, so it easily turns away from what is true and good.
That is the source of my error and sin.
Here is an example ·of how (1) the will’s behaviour when
there is true understanding contrasts with (2) its behaviour
when there isn’t·. (1) A while ago I asked whether anything
in the world exists, and I came to realize that the fact of
my raising this question shows quite clearly that I exist. I
understood this so vividly that I couldn’t help judging that it
was true. This was not the ‘couldn’t help’ that comes from
being compelled by some external force. What happened was
just this: a great light in the intellect was followed by a great
inclination in the will. I was not in a state of indifference,
·feeling that I could as well go one way as the other·; but this
lack of indifference was a measure of how spontaneous and
free my belief was. ·It would have indicated unfreedom only
if it had come from the compulsion of something external,
rather than coming from within myself·. (2) As well as
knowing that I exist, at least as a thinking thing, I have
in my mind an idea of corporeal nature; and I am not sure
whether my thinking nature—which makes me what I am—is
20
Meditations René Descartes Fourth Meditation
the same as this corporeal nature or different from it. I take
it that my intellect has not yet found any convincing reason
for either answer; so I am indifferent with regard to this
question—nothing pushes or pulls me towards one answer
or the other, or indeed towards giving any answer.
The will is indifferent not only when the intellect is
wholly ignorant but also when it doesn’t have clear enough
knowledge at the time when the will is trying to reach a
decision. A probable conjecture may pull me one way; but
when I realize that it is a mere conjecture and not a certain
and indubitable reason, that in itself will push me the other
way. My experience in the last few days confirms this: the
mere fact that I found all my previous beliefs to be somewhat
open to doubt was enough to switch me from confidently
believing them to supposing them to be wholly false.
If when I don’t perceive the truth vividly and clearly
enough I simply suspend judgment, it’s clear that I am
behaving correctly and avoiding error. It is a misuse of
my free will to have an opinion in such cases: if I choose the
wrong side I shall be in error; and even if I choose the right
side, I shall be at fault because I’ll have come to the truth
by sheer chance and not through a perception of my intellect.
The latter, as the natural light shows me clearly, should be
what influences my will when I affirm things. I have said
that error is essentially a privation—a lack of something that
I should have—and now I know what this privation consists
in. It doesn’t lie in •the will that God has given me, or even
in •the mode of operation that God has built into it; rather it
consists in •my misuse of my will. ·Specifically, it consists in
•my lack of restraint in the exercise of my will, when I form
opinions on matters that I don’t clearly understand·.
I can’t complain that God did not give me a greater power
of understanding than he did: created intellects are naturally
finite, and so they naturally lack understanding of many
things. God has never owed me anything, so I should thank
him for his great generosity to me, rather than feeling cheated
because he did not give me everything.
Nor can I reasonably complain that God gave me a will
that extends more widely than my intellect. The will is a
single unitary thing; its nature is such, it seems, that there
could be no way of taking away parts of it. Anyway, should
not the great extent of my will be a cause for further thanks
to him who gave it to me?
Finally, I must not complain that God consents to the
acts of will in which I go wrong. What there is in these
acts that comes from God is wholly true and good; and it
is a perfection in me that I can perform them. Falsity and
error are essentially a privation; and this privation has no
need for help from God, because it isn’t a thing, a being.
Indeed, when it is considered in relation to God as its cause,
it isn’t really a privation but rather a mere negation. ·That
is, it is a mere fact about something that is not the case; it
does not involve the notion that it ought to be the case. I
ought to restrain my will when I don’t understand, but it
isn’t true that God ought to have forced such restraint on
me·. God has given me the freedom to assent or not assent
in cases where he did not give me clear understanding; he is
surely not to blame for that. But I am to blame for misusing
that freedom by coming to conclusions on matters that I
don’t fully understand. Of course God easily could have
arranged things so that, while keeping all my freedom and
still being limited in what I understand, I never made a
mistake. He could do this either by •giving me a vivid and
clear understanding of everything that I was ever likely to
think about; or by •forcing me always to remember that I
ought not to form opinions on matters I don’t vividly and
clearly understand. I can see that if God had made me this
way, I would—considered just in myself, as if nothing else
21
Meditations René Descartes Fourth Meditation
existed—have been more perfect than I actually am. But the
universe as a whole may have some perfection that requires
that some parts of it be capable of error while others are
not, so that it would be a worse universe if all its parts were
exactly alike ·in being immune from error·. I am not entitled
to complain about God’s giving me a lower role in his scheme
of things ·by selecting me as one of the creatures that isn’t
protected from error·.
What is more, even if I have no power to avoid error
by •having a vivid perception of everything I have to think
about, I can avoid it simply by •remembering to withhold
judgment on anything that isn’t clear to me. I admit to
having the weakness that I can’t keep my attention fixed on
a single item of knowledge (·such as the suspend-judgmentwhen-clarity-is-lacking rule·); but by attentive and repeated
meditation I can get myself to remember it as often as the
need arises, and thus to get into the habit of avoiding error.
This is where man’s greatest and most important perfection is to be found; so today’s meditation, with its enquiry
into the cause of error, has been very profitable. I must be
right in my explanation of the cause of error. If I restrain
my will so that I form opinions only on what the intellect
vividly and clearly reveals, I cannot possibly go wrong. Here
is why. Every vivid and clear perception is undoubtedly
something real and positive; so it can’t come from nothing,
and must come from God. He is supremely perfect; it would
be downright contradictory to suppose that he is a deceiver.
So the vivid and clear perception must be true. Today, then,
I have learned not only how to avoid error but also how to
arrive at the truth. It is beyond question that I shall reach
the truth if I think hard enough about •the things that I
perfectly understand, keeping them separate from •all the
other matters in which my thoughts are more confused and
obscure. That is what I shall be really careful to do from now
on.

Meditations René Descartes Fifth Meditation
Fifth Meditation:
The essence of material things, and the existence of God considered a second time
There are many enquiries still to be made about God’s
attributes, and many about my own nature (that is, the
nature of my mind). I may take these up at some time; but
right now I have a more pressing task. Now that I have seen
how to reach the truth—what to do and what to avoid—I
must try to escape from the doubts that beset me a few days
ago, and see whether anything can be known for certain
about material objects.
Before enquiring into whether there are any such things,
I should consider the ideas of them in my thought, in order
to see which of those ideas are distinct and which confused.
I distinctly imagine quantity—that is, the length, breadth
and depth of the quantity, or rather of the thing that is
quantified. I also enumerate the thing’s parts, to which I
attribute various sizes, shapes, positions and movements;
and to the movements I attribute various durations, ·that is,
I say how long each movement lasts·.
Size, shape, position and so on are well known and
transparent to me as general kinds of phenomenon, but
there are also countless particular facts involving them that
I perceive when I attend to them. The truths about all these
matters are so open to me, and so much in harmony with
my nature, that when I first discover any of them it feels
less like •learning something new than like •remembering
something I had known before, or •noticing for the first time
something that was already in my mind without my having
turned my mental gaze onto it.
The most important point is that I find in myself countless
ideas of things that can’t be called nothing, even if they don’t
exist anywhere outside me. For although I am free to think
of these ideas or not, as I choose, I didn’t invent them: they
have their own true and immutable natures, ·which are not
under my control·. Even if there are not and never were
any triangles outside my thought, still, when I imagine a
triangle ·I am constrained in how I do this, because· there is
a determinate nature or essence or form of triangle that is
eternal, unchanging, and independent of my mind. Consider
the things that I can prove about the triangle—that its three
angles equal two right angles, that its longest side is opposite
its greatest angle, and so on. I now clearly recognize these
properties of the triangle, whether I want to or not, even if I
didn’t give them a thought when the triangle first came into
my mind. So they can’t have been invented by me.
It does not help to point out that I have sometimes seen
triangular bodies, so that the idea of the triangle might have
come to me from them through my sense organs. I can
prove truths about the properties not only of triangles but of
countless other shapes that I know I have never encountered
through the senses. These properties must be something,
not pure nothing: whatever is true is something; and these
properties are true because I am clearly aware of them. (I
have already proved that everything of which I am clearly
aware is true; and even if I hadn’t proved it, my mind is so
constituted that I have to assent to these ·geometrical· propositions as long as I perceive them.) I remember, too, that even
back in the times when the objects of the senses held my
attention, I regarded the clearly apprehended propositions of
pure mathematics—including arithmetic and geometry—as
the most certain of all.

Meditations René Descartes Fifth Meditation
·The preceding two paragraphs lead to this conclusion·:
The mere fact that I find in my thought an idea of something
x, and vividly and clearly perceive x to have a certain property,
it follows that x really does have that property. Can I not turn
this to account in an argument - a demonstrative proof of
the existence of God? The idea of God (that is, of a supremely
perfect being) is certainly one that I find within me, just as I
find the ideas of shapes and numbers; and I understand
·from this idea· that it belongs to God’s nature that he
always exists. This understanding is just as vivid and clear
as what is involved in ·mathematical· proofs of the properties
of shapes and numbers. So even if I have sometimes gone
wrong in my meditations in these past days, I ought still to
regard the existence of God as being at least as certain as I
have taken the truths of mathematics to be.
At first sight, this looks like a trick. Where things other
than God are involved, I have been accustomed to distinguish
a thing’s existence from its essence. ·The question ‘What
is the essence of triangles (or flames or sparrows)?’ asks
what it takes for something to qualify as a triangle (or flame
or sparrow). Answering this still leaves open the existence
question, which asks whether there are any triangles (or
flames or sparrows)·. I can easily believe that in the case of
God, also, existence can be separated from essence, ·letting
us answer the •essence question about God while leaving the
•existence question open·, so that God can be thought of as
not existing. But on more careful reflection it becomes quite
evident that, just as having-internal-angles-equal-to-180°
can’t be separated from the idea ·or essence· of a triangle,
and as the idea of highlands can’t be separated from the
idea of lowlands, so existence can’t be separated from the
essence of God. Just as it is self-contradictory to think of
highlands in a world where there are no lowlands, so it is
self-contradictory to think of God as not existing—that is, to
think of a supremely perfect being as lacking a perfection,
namely the perfection of existence. [What Descartes wrote is
usually translated as ‘mountains in a world where there are no valleys’,
but that is obviously not self-contradictory. The Latin provides no escape
from this, but Descartes may have been thinking in French, in which
vallée can mean ‘valley’ in our sense but can be used to refer to foothills,
the lower slopes of a mountain, or the plain immediately surrounding the
mountain. So ‘highlands’/‘lowlands’ has been adopted as a compromise:
compact and fairly close to what he presumably meant.]
·Here is a possible objection to the preceding two paragraphs·:
I can’t think of God except as existing, just as I can’t
think of a river without banks. From the latter fact,
though, it certainly doesn’t follow that there are any
rivers in the world; so why should it follow from the
former fact that God exists? How things are in reality
is not settled by my thought; and just as I can imagine
a winged horse even though no horse has wings, so I
can attach existence to God in my thought even if no
God exists.
This involves false reasoning. From the fact that I can’t think
of a river without banks, it does not follow that a river with
banks exists anywhere, but simply that river and banks—
whether or not there are any in reality—are inseparable. On
the other hand, from the fact that I can’t think of God except
as existing it follows that God and existence are inseparable,
which is to say that God really exists. My thought doesn’t
make it so; it doesn’t create necessities. The influence runs
the opposite way: the necessity of the thing constrains how
I can think, depriving me of the freedom to think of God
without existence (that is, a supremely perfect being without
a supreme perfection), like my freedom to imagine a horse
with or without wings.
24
Meditations René Descartes Fifth Meditation
Here is a ·further· possible objection to this line of
thought:
Admittedly, once I have supposed that •all perfections
belong to God, I must suppose that he exists, because
existence is one of the perfections. But what entitles
me to suppose God to have all perfections? Similarly,
if I suppose that •all quadrilaterals can be inscribed
in a circle, I have to conclude that a rhombus can be
inscribed in a circle; but that is plainly false, which
shows that the original supposition was wrong.
I agree that I don’t have to think about God at all; but
whenever I do choose to think of him, bringing the idea of
the first and supreme being out of my mind’s store, I must
attribute all perfections to him, even if I don’t attend to them
individually straight away. This necessity ·in my thought·
guarantees that, when I later realize that existence is a
perfection, I am right to conclude then that the first and
supreme being exists. Similarly, I don’t ever have to imagine
a triangle; but whenever I do wish to consider a figure with
straight sides and three angles, I must attribute to it properties from which it follows that its three angles equal no more
than 180°, even if I don’t notice this at the time. When on
the other hand I examine what figures can be inscribed in a
circle, I am not compelled to think that this class includes all
quadrilaterals. Indeed, I cannot—while thinking vividly and
clearly—even pretend that all quadrilaterals can be inscribed
in a circle. This kind of false pretence is vastly different from
the true ideas that are innate in me, of which the first and
chief is the idea of God. This idea isn’t a fiction, a creature of
my thought, but rather an image of a true and unchanging
nature; and I have several indications that this is so. •God
is the only thing I can think of whose existence necessarily
belongs to its essence. •I can’t make sense of there being
two or more Gods of this kind; and after supposing that
one God exists, I plainly see that it is necessary that he has
existed from eternity and will stay in existence for eternity.
•I perceive many other attributes of God, none of which I can
remove or alter.
Whatever method of proof I use, though, I am always
brought back to the fact that nothing completely convinces
me except what I vividly and clearly perceive. Some things
that I vividly and clearly perceive are obvious to everyone;
others can be learned only through more careful investigation, but once they are discovered they are judged to be just
as certain as the obvious ones. (Compare these two truths
about right-angled triangles: ‘The square on the hypotenuse
equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides’ and
‘The hypotenuse is opposite the largest angle’. The former
is less obvious than the latter; but once one has seen it,
one believes it just as strongly.) ·Truths about God are not
in the immediately obvious class, but they ought to be·. If
I were not swamped by preconceived opinions, and if my
thoughts were not hemmed in and pushed around by images
of things perceived by the senses, I would acknowledge God
sooner and more easily than anything else. The supreme
being exists; God, the only being whose essence includes
existence, exists; what is more self-evident than that?
Although I came to see this only through careful thought,
I am now just as certain of it as I am of anything at all. Not
only that, but I see that all other certainties depend on this
one, so that without it I can’t know anything for sure. ·The
next two paragraphs explain why this is so·.
While I am perceiving something vividly and clearly, I
can’t help believing it to be true. That is a fact about my
nature. Here is another: I can’t fix my mind’s eye continually
on the same thing, so as to keep perceiving it clearly; so that
sometimes the arguments that led me to a certain conclusion
slip out of my focus of attention, though I remember the
25
Meditations René Descartes Fifth Meditation
conclusion itself. That threatens me with the following state
of affairs, from which I am protected only by being aware of
the existence of God:
In a case where I am not attending to the arguments
that led me to a conclusion, my confidence in the
conclusion might be undermined by arguments going
the other way. When I think hard about triangles, for
instance, it seems quite obvious to me—steeped as
I am in the principles of geometry—that a triangle’s
three angles are equal to 180°; and while I am attending to the proof of this I can’t help believing it. But
as soon as I turn my mind’s eye away from the proof,
then in spite of still remembering that I perceived it
very clearly ·but without now getting it clear in my
mind again·, I can easily doubt its truth. So nothing
is ever finally established and settled—I can have no
true and certain knowledge, but only shifting and
changeable opinions. For I can convince myself that I
am naturally liable to go wrong sometimes in matters
that I think I perceive as evidently as can be. This
seems even more likely when I remember that I have
often regarded as certainly true some propositions
that other arguments have later led me to think false.
That is what my situation would be if I were not aware of the
existence of God.
But now I have seen that God exists, and have understood
that everything else depends on him and that he is not a
deceiver; from which I have inferred that everything that I
vividly and clearly perceive must be true. So even when I
am no longer attending to the arguments that led me to
accept this (·i.e. the proposition about triangles·), as long
as I remember that I vividly and clearly perceived it no
counter-arguments can make me doubt it. It is something
that I know for certain ·and in an unshakable way· to be true.
That applies not only to this one proposition but to anything
that I remember ever having proved in geometry and the like.
Why should I call these matters into doubt? •Because I am
so built as to be prone to frequent error? No: I now know
that when I have something in mind in a transparently clear
way I cannot be in error about it. •Because I have in the
past regarded as certainly true many things that I afterwards
recognized to be false? No: the things that I later came to
doubt had not been vividly and clearly perceived in the first
place: I had come to accept them for reasons that I later
found to be unreliable, because I hadn’t yet discovered this
rule for establishing the truth. •Because I may be dreaming,
so that my present thoughts have as little truth as those
of a person who is asleep? I put this objection to myself a
while ago. It doesn’t change anything, because if something
is evident to my intellect, even when I am dreaming, then it
is true.
Thus I see plainly that the certainty and truth of all
knowledge depends strictly on my awareness of the true
God. So much so that until I became aware of him I
couldn’t perfectly know anything. Now I can achieve full
and certain knowledge of countless matters, both concerning
God himself and other things whose nature is intellectual,
and also concerning the whole of the corporeal nature that
is the subject-matter of pure mathematics.
26
Meditations René Descartes Sixth Meditation
Sixth Meditation:
The existence of material things, and the real distinction between mind and body
The remaining task is to consider whether material things
exist. Insofar as they are the subject-matter of pure mathematics, I perceive [here = ‘conceive’] them vividly and clearly; so
I at least know that they could exist, because anything that I
perceive in that way could be created by God. (The only reason I have ever accepted for thinking that •something could
not be made by him is that there would be a contradiction in
my perceiving •it distinctly.) My faculty of imagination, which
I am aware of using when I turn my mind to material things,
also suggests that such things really exist. For when I think
hard about what imagination is, I find that it is nothing but
an application of •the faculty of knowing to •a body that
is intimately present to it—and that has to be a body that
exists.
To make this clear, I will first examine how •imagination
differs from •pure understanding. When I imagine a triangle,
for example, I don’t merely •understand that it is a threesided figure, but I also •see the three lines with my mind’s
eye as if they were present to me; that is what imagining is.
But if I think of a chiliagon [= ‘thousand-sided figure’, pronounced
kill-ee-a-gon], although I •understand quite well that it is a
figure with a thousand sides, I don’t •imagine the thousand
sides or see them as if they were present to me. When I
think of a body, I usually form some kind of image; so in
thinking of a chiliagon I may construct in my mind—·strictly
speaking, in my imagination·—a confused representation of
some figure. But obviously it won’t be a chiliagon, for it is
the very same image that I would form if I were thinking of,
say, a figure with ten thousand sides. So it wouldn’t help
me to recognize the properties that distinguish a chiliagon
from other many-sided figures. In the case of a pentagon,
the situation is different. I can of course understand this
figure without the help of the imagination (just as I can
understand a chiliagon); but I can also imagine a pentagon,
by applying my mind’s eye to its five sides and the area they
enclose. This imagining, I find, takes more mental effort
than understanding does; and that is enough to show clearly
that imagination is different from pure understanding.
Being able to imagine isn’t essential to me, as being able
to understand is; for even if I had no power of imagination
I would still be the same individual that I am. This seems
to imply that my power of imagining depends on something
other than myself; and I can easily understand that ·if there
is such a thing as my body—that is·, if my mind is joined to a
certain body in such a way that it can contemplate that body
whenever it wants to—then it might be this very body that
enables me to imagine corporeal things. So it may be that
imagining differs from pure understanding purely like this:
•when the mind understands, it somehow turns in on itself
and inspects one of its own ideas; but •when it imagines, it
turns away from itself and looks at something in the body
that conforms to an idea—either one understood by the mind
or one perceived by the senses). I can, I repeat, easily see
that this might be how imagination comes about if the body
exists; and since I can think of no other equally good way
of explaining what imagination is, I can conjecture that the
body exists. But this is only a probability. Even after all my
careful enquiry I still can’t see how, on the basis of the idea
of corporeal nature that I find in my imagination, to prove
for sure that some body exists.
27
Meditations René Descartes Sixth Meditation
As well as the corporeal nature that is the subject-matter
of pure mathematics, I am also accustomed to imagining
colours, sounds, tastes, pain and so on—though not so
distinctly. Now, I perceive these much better by means of
the senses, which is how (helped by memory) they appear
to have reached the imagination. So in order to deal with
them more fully, I must attend to the senses—that is, to
the kind of thinking [here = ‘mental activity’] that I call ‘sensory
perception’. I want to know whether the things that are
perceived through the senses provide me with any sure
argument for the existence of bodies.
To begin with, I will (1) go back over everything that I
originally took to be perceived by the senses, and reckoned
to be true; and I will go over my reasons for thinking this.
Next, I will (2) set out my reasons for later doubting these
things. Finally, I will (3) consider what I should now believe
about them.
(1) First of all, then, I perceived by my senses that I had a
head, hands, feet and other limbs making up the body that I
regarded as part of myself, or perhaps even as my whole self.
I also perceived by my senses that this body was situated
among many other bodies that could harm or help it; and
I detected the favourable effects by a sensation of pleasure
and the unfavourable ones by pain. As well as pain and
pleasure, I also had sensations of hunger, thirst, and other
such appetites, and also of bodily states tending towards
cheerfulness, sadness, anger and similar emotions. Outside
myself, besides the extension, shapes and movements of
bodies, I also had sensations of their hardness and heat,
and of the other qualities that can be known by touch. In
addition, I had sensations of light, colours, smells, tastes
and sounds, and differences amongst these enabled me to
sort out the sky, the earth, the seas and other bodies from
one another. All I was immediately aware of in each case
were my ideas, but it was reasonable for me to think that
what I was perceiving through the senses were external
bodies that caused the ideas. For I found that these ideas
came to me quite without my consent: I couldn’t have that
kind of idea of any object, even if I wanted to, if the object
was not present to my sense organs; and I couldn’t avoid
having the idea when the object was present. Also, since the
ideas that came through the senses were much more lively
and vivid and sharp than •ones that I formed voluntarily
when thinking about things, and than •ones that I found
impressed on my memory, it seemed impossible that sensory
ideas were coming from within me; so I had to conclude that
they came from external things. My only way of knowing
about these things was through the ideas themselves, so it
was bound to occur to me that the things might resemble
the ideas. In addition, I remembered that I had the use of
my senses before I ever had the use of reason; and I saw that
the ideas that I formed were mostly composed of elements
of sensory ideas. This convinced me that I had nothing at
all in my intellect that I had not previously had in sensation.
As for the body that by some special right I called ‘mine’: I
had reason to think that it belonged to me in a way that no
other body did. ·There were three reasons for this·. •I could
never be separated from it, as I could from other bodies; •I
felt all my appetites and emotions in it and on account of it;
and •I was aware of pain and pleasurable ticklings in parts
of this body but not in any other body. But why should that
curious sensation of pain give rise to a particular distress of
mind; and why should a certain kind of delight follow on a
tickling sensation? Again, why should that curious tugging
in the stomach that I call ‘hunger’ tell me that I should eat,
or a dryness of the throat tell me to drink, and so on? I
couldn’t explain any of this, except to say that nature taught
me so. For there is no connection (or none that I understand)
28
Meditations René Descartes Sixth Meditation
between the tugging sensation and the decision to eat, or
between the sensation of something causing pain and the
mental distress that arises from it. It seems that nature
taught me to make these judgments about objects of the
senses, for I was making them before I had any arguments
to support them.
(2) Later on, however, my experiences gradually undermined all my faith in the senses. A tower that had looked
round from a distance appeared square from close up; an
enormous statue standing on a high column didn’t look large
from the ground. In countless such cases I found that the
judgments of the external senses were mistaken, and the
same was true of the internal senses. What can be more
internal than pain? Yet I heard that an amputee might
occasionally seem to feel pain in the missing limb. So even
in my own case, I had to conclude, it was not quite certain
that a particular limb was hurting, even if I felt pain in it. To
these reasons for doubting, I recently added two very general
ones. •The first was that every sensory experience I ever
thought I was having while awake I can also think of myself
as having while asleep; and since I don’t believe that what
I seem to perceive in sleep comes from things outside me, I
didn’t see why I should be any more inclined to believe this
of what I think I perceive while awake. •The second reason
for doubt was that for all I knew to the contrary I might be
so constituted that I am liable to error even in matters that
seem to me most true. (I couldn’t rule this out, because I
did not know—or at least was pretending not to know—who
made me.) And it was easy to refute the reasons for my
earlier confidence about the truth of what I perceived by the
senses. Since I seemed to be naturally drawn towards many
things that reason told me to avoid, I reckoned that I should
not place much confidence in what I was taught by nature.
Also, I decided, the mere fact that the perceptions of the
senses didn’t depend on my will was not enough to show
that they came from outside me; for they might have been
produced by some faculty of mine that I didn’t yet know.
(3) But now, when I am beginning to know myself and
my maker better, I don’t think I should recklessly accept
everything I seem to have acquired from the senses, but I
don’t think I should call it all into doubt.
First, I know that if I have a vivid and clear thought of
something, God could have created it in a way that exactly
corresponds to my thought. So the fact that I can vividly and
clearly think of one thing apart from another assures me that
the two things are distinct from one another—·that is, that
they are two·—since they can be separated by God. Never
mind how they could be separated; that does not affect the
judgment that they are distinct. ·So my mind is a distinct
thing from my body. Furthermore, my mind is me, for the
following reason·. I know that I exist and that nothing else
belongs to my nature or essence except that I am a thinking
thing; from this it follows that my essence consists solely in
my being a thinking thing, even though there may be a body
that is very closely joined to me. I have a vivid and clear
idea of •myself as something that thinks and isn’t extended,
and a clear idea of •body as something extended that does
not think. So it is certain that •I am really distinct from •my
body and can exist without it.
Besides this, I find that I am capable of certain special
kinds of thinking [= ‘mental activity’], namely imagination and
sensory perception. Now, I can vividly and clearly understand •myself as a whole without •these faculties; but I
can’t understand •them without •me, that is, without an
intellectual substance for them to belong to. A faculty or
ability essentially involves acts, so it involves some thing
that acts; so I see that •I differ from •my faculties as •a
thing differs from •its properties. Of course there are other
29
Meditations René Descartes Sixth Meditation
faculties—such as those of moving around, changing shape,
and so on—which also need a substance to belong to; but it
must be a bodily or extended substance and not a thinking
one, because a vivid and clear conception of those faculties
includes extension but not thought. Now, I have a passive
faculty of sensory perception, that is, an ability to receive
and recognize ideas of perceptible objects; but I would have
no use for this unless something—myself or something
else—had an active faculty for producing those ideas in the
first place. But this faculty can’t be in me, since clearly it
does not presuppose any thought on my part, and sensory
ideas are produced without my cooperation and often even
against my will. So sensory ideas must be produced by
some substance other than me—a substance that actually
has (either in a straightforward way or in a higher form) all
the reality that is represented in the ideas that it produces.
Either (a) this substance is a body, in which case it will
•straightforwardly contain everything that is represented in
the ideas; or else (b) it is God, or some creature more noble
than a body, in which case it will contain •in a higher form
whatever is to be found in the ideas. I can ·reject (b), and·
be confident that God does not transmit sensory ideas to me
either directly from himself or through some creature that
does not straightforwardly contain what is represented in
the ideas. God has given me no way of recognizing any such
‘higher form’ source for these ideas; on the contrary, he has
strongly inclined me to believe that bodies produce them.
So if the ideas were transmitted from a source other than
corporeal things, God would be a deceiver; and he is not. So
bodies exist. They may not all correspond exactly with my
sensory intake of them, for much of what comes in through
the senses is obscure and confused. But at least bodies have
all the properties that I vividly and clearly understand, that
is, all that fall within the province of pure mathematics.
·Those are the •clearly understood properties of bodies •in
general·. What about •less clearly understood properties (for
example light or sound or pain), and properties of •particular
bodies (for example the size or shape of the sun)? Although
there is much doubt and uncertainty about them, I have a
sure hope that I can reach the truth even in these matters.
That is because God isn’t a deceiver, which implies that he
has given me the ability to correct any falsity there may be in
my opinions. Indeed, everything that I am ‘taught by nature’
certainly contains some truth. For by ‘nature’ as a general
term I now mean nothing other than God himself or the
ordered system of created things established by him. And
my own nature is simply the totality of things bestowed on
me by God.
As vividly as it teaches me anything, my own nature
teaches me that I have a body, that when I feel pain there
is something wrong with this body, that when I am hungry
or thirsty it needs food and drink, and so on. So I shouldn’t
doubt that there is some truth in this.
Nature also teaches me, through these sensations of pain,
hunger, thirst and so on, that I (a thinking thing) am not
merely in my body as a sailor is in a ship. Rather, I am
closely joined to it—intermingled with it, so to speak—so
that it and I form a unit. If this were not so, I wouldn’t feel
pain when the body was hurt but would perceive the damage
in an intellectual way, like a sailor seeing that his ship needs
repairs. And when the body needed food or drink I would
intellectually understand this fact instead of (as I do) having
confused sensations of hunger and thirst. These sensations
are confused mental events that arise from the union—the
intermingling, as it were—of the mind with the body.
Nature also teaches me that various other bodies exist
in the vicinity of my body, and that I should seek out some
of these and avoid others. Also, I perceive by my senses a
30
Meditations René Descartes Sixth Meditation
great variety of colours, sounds, smells and tastes, as well
as differences in heat, hardness and so on; from which I
infer that the bodies that cause these sensory perceptions
differ from one another in ways that correspond to the sensory differences, though perhaps they don’t resemble them.
Furthermore, some perceptions are pleasant while others
are nasty, which shows that my body—or rather my whole
self insofar as I am a combination of body and mind—can
be affected by the various helpful or harmful bodies that
surround it.
However, some of what I thought I had learned from
nature really came not from nature but from a habit of
rushing to conclusions; and those beliefs could be false.
Here are a few examples:
•that if a region contains nothing that stimulates my
senses, then it must be empty;
•that the heat in a body resembles my idea of heat;
•that the colour I perceive through my senses is also
present in the body that I perceive;
•that in a body that is bitter or sweet there is the same
taste that I experience, and so on;
•that stars and towers and other distant bodies have
the same size and shape that they present to my
senses.
To think clearly about this matter, I need to define exactly
what I mean when I say that ‘nature teaches me’ something.
I am not at this point taking ‘nature’ to refer to the totality of
what God has given me. From that totality I am excluding
things that belong to the mind alone, such as my knowledge that what has been done can’t be undone (I know this
through the natural light, without help from the body). I am
also excluding things that relate to the body alone, such as
the tendency bodies have to fall downwards. My sole concern
here is with what God has given to me as a combination of
mind and body. My ‘nature’, then, in this limited sense, does
indeed teach me to avoid what hurts and to seek out what
gives pleasure, and so on. But it doesn’t appear to teach
us to rush to conclusions about things located outside us
without pausing to think about the question; for knowledge
of the truth about such things seems to belong to the mind
alone, not to the combination of mind and body. So, although
a star has no more effect on my eye than a candle’s flame,
my thinking of the star as no bigger than the flame does
not come from any positive ·‘natural’· inclination to believe
this; it’s just a habit of thought that I have had ever since
childhood, with no rational basis for it. Similarly, although
I feel heat when I approach a fire and feel pain when I go
too near, there is no good reason to think that something in
the fire resembles the heat, or resembles the pain. There is
merely reason to suppose that something or other in the fire
causes feelings of heat or pain in us. Again, even when a
region contains nothing that stimulates my senses, it does
not follow that it contains no bodies. I now realize that
in these cases and many others I have been in the habit
of misusing the order of nature. The right way to use the
sensory perceptions that nature gives me is as a guide to
what is beneficial or harmful for my mind-body complex; and
they are vivid and clear enough for that. But it is a misuse of
them to treat them as reliable guides to the essential nature
of the bodies located outside me, for on that topic they give
only very obscure and confused information.
I have already looked closely enough at how I may come
to make false judgments, even though God is good. Now
it occurs to me that there is a problem about •mistakes I
make regarding the things that nature tells me to seek out
or avoid, and also regarding •some of my internal sensations.
Some cases of this are unproblematic. Someone may be
tricked into eating pleasant-tasting food that has poison
31
Meditations René Descartes Sixth Meditation
concealed in it; but here nature urges the person towards
the pleasant food, not towards the poison, which it doesn’t
know about. All this shows is that the person’s nature
doesn’t know everything, and that is no surprise.
But often enough we go wrong about things that nature
urges us towards. Sick people, for example, may want food
or drink that is bad for them. ‘They go wrong because they
are ill’—true, but the difficulty remains. A sick man is one of
God’s creatures just as a healthy one is, and in each case it
seems a contradiction to suppose that God has given him a
nature that deceives him.
A badly made clock conforms to the laws of its nature in
telling the wrong time, just as a well made and accurate clock
does; and we might look at the human body in the same
way. We could see it as a kind of machine made up of bones,
nerves, muscles, veins, blood and skin in such a way that,
even if there were no mind in it, it would still move exactly
as it now does in all the cases where movement isn’t under
the control of the will or, therefore, of the mind. If such a
body suffers from dropsy [a disease in which abnormal quantities
of water accumulate in the body], for example, and is affected by
the dryness of the throat that normally produces in the mind
a sensation of thirst, that will affect the nerves and other
bodily parts in such a way as to dispose the body to take
a drink, which will make the disease worse. Yet this is as
natural as a healthy body’s being stimulated by a similar
dryness of the throat to take a drink that is good for it. ·In a
way, we might say, it is not natural·. Just as we could say
that a clock that works badly is ‘departing from its nature’,
we might say that the dropsical body that takes a harmful
drink is ‘departing from its nature’, that is, from the pattern
of movements that usually occur in human bodies. But that
involves using ‘nature’ as a way of comparing one thing with
another—a sick man with a healthy one, a badly made clock
with an accurate one—whereas I have been using ‘nature’
not to make comparisons but to speak of what can be found
in the things themselves; and this usage is legitimate.
When we describe a dropsical body as having ‘a disordered nature’, therefore, we are using the term ‘nature’
merely to compare sick with healthy. What has gone wrong
in the mind-body complex that suffers from dropsy, however,
is not a mere matter of comparison with something else.
There is here a real, intrinsic error of nature, namely that
the body is thirsty at a time when drink will cause it harm.
We have to enquire how it is that the goodness of God does
not prevent nature from deceiving us in this way. ·This
enquiry will fall into four main parts·.
•There is a great difference between the mind and the
body. Every body is by its nature divisible, but the mind
can’t be divided. When I consider the mind—i.e. consider
myself purely as a thinking thing—I can’t detect any parts
within myself; I understand myself to be something single
and complete. The whole mind seems to be united to the
whole body, ·but not by a uniting of parts to parts, because:·
If a foot or arm or any other part of the body is cut off,
nothing is thereby taken away from the mind. As for the
faculties of willing, of understanding, of sensory perception
and so on, these are not parts of the mind, since it is one
and the same mind that wills, understands and perceives.
·They are (I repeat) not parts of the mind, because they are
properties or powers of it·. By contrast, any corporeal thing
can easily be divided into parts in my thought; and this
shows me that it is really divisible. This one argument would
be enough to show me that the mind is completely different
from the body, even if I did not already know as much from
other considerations ·in (3) on page 29·.
•The mind isn’t immediately affected by all parts of the
body but only by the brain—or perhaps just by the small part
32
Meditations René Descartes Sixth Meditation
of it which is said to contain the ‘common sense’. [Descartes is
referring to the pineal gland. The ‘common sense’ was a supposed faculty,
postulated by Aristotle, whose role was to integrate the data from the five
specialized senses.] The signals that reach the mind depend
upon what state this part of the brain is in, irrespective
of the condition of the other parts of the body. There is
abundant experimental evidence for this, which I needn’t
review here.
•Whenever any part of the body is moved by another part
that is some distance away, it can be moved in the same
fashion by any of the parts that lie in between, without the
more distant part doing anything. For example, in a cord
ABCD, if one end D is pulled so that the other end A moves,
A could have been moved in just the same way if B or C had
been pulled and D had not moved at all. Similarly, when I
feel a pain in my foot, this happens by means of nerves that
run from the foot up to the brain. When the nerves are pulled
in the foot, they pull on inner parts of the brain and make
them move; and nature has laid it down that this motion
should produce in the mind a sensation of pain as though
occurring in the foot. But since these nerves stretch from
the foot to the brain through the calf, the thigh, the lumbar
region, the back and the neck, that same sensation of ‘pain
in the foot’ can come about when one of the intermediate
parts is pulled, even if nothing happens in the foot. This
presumably holds for any other sensation.
•One kind of movement in the part of the brain that
immediately affects the mind always produces just one kind
of sensation; and it would be best for us if it were always
the kind that would contribute the most to keeping us alive
and well. Experience shows that the sensations that nature
has given us are all of just such kinds; so everything about
them bears witness to the power and goodness of God. For
example, when the nerves in the foot are set in motion in a
violent and unusual manner, this motion reaches the inner
parts of the brain via the spinal cord, and gives the mind its
signal for having a sensation of a pain as occurring in the
foot. This stimulates the mind to do its best to remove the
cause of the pain, which it takes to be harmful to the foot.
God could have made our nature such that this motion in
the brain indicated something else to the mind—for example,
making the mind aware of the actual motion occurring in the
brain, or in the foot, or in any of the intermediate regions.
[Descartes is here contrasting the foot with other parts of the body, and
contrasting a feeling of pain with a merely intellectual awareness that a
movement is occurring.] But nothing else would have been so
conducive to the continued well-being of the body. In the
same way, when we need drink a certain dryness arises in
the throat; this moves the nerves of the throat, which in turn
move the inner parts of the brain. That produces in the mind
a sensation of thirst, because the most useful thing for us
to know at this point is that we need drink in order to stay
healthy. Similarly in the other cases.
All of this makes it clear that, despite God’s immense
goodness, the nature of man as a combination of mind and
body is such that it is bound to mislead him from time to
time. For along the route of the nerves from the foot to the
brain, or even in the brain itself, something may happen that
produces the same motion that is usually caused by injury
to the foot; and then pain will be felt as if it were in the foot.
This deception of the senses is natural, because a given kind
of motion in the brain must always produce the same kind
of sensation in the mind; and, given that this kind of motion
usually originates in the foot, it is reasonable that it should
produce a sensation indicating a pain in the foot. Similarly
with dryness of the throat: it is much better that it should
mislead on the rare occasion when the person has dropsy
than that it should always mislead when the body is in good
33
Meditations René Descartes Sixth Meditation
health. The same holds for the other cases.
This line of thought greatly helps me to be aware of all
the errors to which my nature is liable, and also to correct
or avoid them. For I know that so far as bodily well-being
is concerned my senses usually tell the truth. Also, I can
usually employ more than one sense to investigate the same
thing; and I can get further help from my memory, which
connects present experiences with past ones, and from my
intellect, which has by now examined all the sources of error.
So I should have no more fears about the falsity of what my
senses tell me every day; on the contrary, the exaggerated
doubts of the last few days should be dismissed as laughable.
This applies especially to the chief reason for doubt, namely
my inability to distinguish dreams from waking experience.
For I now notice that the two are vastly different, in that
dreams are never linked by memory with all the other actions
of life as waking experiences are. If, while I am awake, a
man were suddenly to appear to me and then disappear
immediately, as happens in sleep, so that I couldn’t see
where he had come from or where he had gone to, I could
reasonably judge that he was a ghost or an hallucination
rather than a real man. But if I have a firm grasp of when,
where and whence something comes to me, and if I can
connect my perception of it with the whole of the rest of my
life without a break, then I am sure that in encountering
it I am not asleep but awake. And I ought not to have any
doubt of its reality if that is unanimously confirmed by all
my senses as well as my memory and intellect. From the fact
that God isn’t a deceiver it follows that in cases like this I
am completely free from error. But since everyday pressures
don’t always allow us to pause and check so carefully, it
must be admitted that human life is vulnerable to error about
particular things, and we must acknowledge the weakness
of our nature.
